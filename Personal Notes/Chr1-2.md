- Base Training (different from aerobic-basic training that is performed by endurance athletes in offseason training): develop an initial aerobic base in clients who have been insufficiently active (non-consistently performing moderate-intensity cardio for at least 20 mins on at least 3 days per week). The goal is to create early positive exercise experiences while gradually increasing duration and frequency.
  
- Fitness Training: focus on enhancing the client's aerobic efficiency by progressing the program based on individual goals.
  
- Performance Training: for individuals with goals focused on success in endurance sports and events.

- Functional Training: to establish or re-establish postural stability and kinetic chain mobility by improving joint function, muscular endurance, flexibility, core function static balance, and dynamic balance.
  
- Movement Training: to develop good movement patterns without compromising postural or joint stability. Five primary movements: bend-and-lift movements, single-leg movement, pushing movement, pulling movement, and rotational movement. Emphasize the proper sequencing of movement and control of COG.
  
- Load/speed Training: to create a need for increased force production with external loads to movement; should integrate Functional Training exercise of the five primary movements. The goals include muscular strength, muscular endurance, muscle hypertrophy, and positive changes in body composition.
