# Chr12: Considerations for Clients with Obesity

General consideration: emphasize total energy expenditure (e.g. walk/run distance), challenge clients with obesity might face when exercising in the heat - modify intensity; skin chafing and potential joint concerns; the psychological impact of certain types of exercise (aquatic exercise); mobility or balance challenges; lifestyle physical activity (non-exercise activity thermogenesis, NEAT).

## Possible causes of obesity

![IMG_1121](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/65ebefe8-576c-4d67-9926-cf42f1da2c36)

Simplistically as the result of an imbalance between calories consumed/energy intake/EI and calories expended/energy expenditure/EE. 

Major factors: Environment, genetic predisposition, and human behavior; specifically environmental factors such as food (availability, quantity, energy density), labor-saving devices, and setting time(pollution is not a relevant environmental factor), stress (stimulate hunger), genetics, hormones (leptin - negative loop of "fat energy feeling", adiponectin - insulin and blood sugar, immune hormones, appetite-regulating hormones such as ghrelin), sleep, and energy balance.



## Nutritional Guidelines

Reduce fat and/or carbohydrate intake to obtain a caloric deficit of 500 - 1000 kcal per day to produce a weight loss of 1/2 lbs per week (based on ~3,500 kcal equals 1 lb of fat). Other recommendations include portion control (serving size and calories in various foods), eating frequency (eating throughout the day), and consuming foods high in nutrient density (nutrient per calorie, considering vitamins minerals, and phytochemicals) and low in energy density (calories per weight or volume, typically high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and low in fat, sweetened beverages and alcohol >> whole food, plant-based diet). 

![IMG_1126](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/c8ede8d0-e7f0-4a88-a6ee-4b418530bd3e)

The current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 46-56 g/day or 10-35% of total caloric intake.

Resting energy expenditure (REE, 60-75% TEE, Total energy expenditure): male (10 * weight in kg) + (6.35 * height in cm) - (5 * age) + 5; female male (10 * weight in kg) + (6.35 * height in cm) - (5 * age) - 161. 

When evaluating, consider: how does the diet cut calories, what is the nutrient density, does the diet recommend exercise, does it make sense, where's the evidence, does it meet individual needs, how much does it cost, what kind of social support does the client have, how easy is it to adhere



## Exercise Guidelines

![IMG_1127](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/0732b765-71b7-42ec-877b-bcd280522d8f)

Given that the total EE is more important, emphasis should be placed on the total distance or time walked or run (e.g. 10 minutes walking * 3). Be aware that clients with obesity will likely experience challenges when in the heat >> swimming and water exercise with less stress on the joints. Some exercise may not be a good choice due to mobility and/or balance problems. Help the client to release the non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) -  the importance of daily activities such as fidgeting, walking, and standing >> Lifestyle change.  

- Cardio training:

![IMG_1122](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/87d52c0d-dc86-4b6e-96be-6d3e76374721)

Frequency: as active as possible and work up to at least five days per week. Moderate-intensity cardio at at least three days per week for bouts 20 minutes will begin in the Base Training phase. Lifestyle activities should be done often throughout each day.

Intensity: to moderate intensity. Using talk test, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale of "somewhat hard" / 3-4 out of 10

Time: 30-60 minutes per day, can be done in one session or multiple shorter bouts. 

Type: low-impact, rhythmic exercises using large muscle groups.

Initial Programming Considerations: health benefits. gradually increase the frequency, duration, and/or intensity over a long period. Be careful about the risk of injury especially in the first few months.

Biomechanical consideration for cardio exercise: The preferred type would be a combination of weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing (swim) models. Be performing longer on/or more frequent bouts. Monitor muscle soreness and any orthopedic problem or discomfort. Wear high-quality fitness shoes with good shock-absorbing qualities to minimize joint problems.

Suggested reduction after 13 weeks in clients with overweight: 4 (0.5-13.5) lbs in weight, 1 (0.25-2.35) inches in waist circumference, 3.5 (2-8)% in body fat.

- Muscular training

![IMG_1123](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/0c075766-b1d6-4aa4-b664-ceb7c0c91c27)

Frequency: 2-3 days per week with a day of rest between sessions. Intensity: moderate level, 60-70% 1-RM. Time: depends, full-body muscular training should require 20-30 minutes. Type: all major muscle groups using free weight and/or machine.


## Exercise and Weight Management

![IMG_1124](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/ead1369f-4f4a-4cbb-a708-b14b7e70a54c)

Resting energy expenditure contributes 60-75% of the body's total energy. 

In the absence of concurrent caloric restriction, cardio exercise in the range of 150 minutes per week has been associated with moderate weight loss (4.4-6.6 lbs), while 250-420 minutes results in an 11-16.5 lbs loss. The combination of exercise and a sense of eating plan produces the best long-term weight-loss and weight-maintenance results. 

In addition to increased EE and a modified diet with reduced EI, "a comprehensive weight management program should take maximum use of multiple strategies for cognitive behavioral therapy" - calorie reduction, physical activity, and behavioral changes. Consider maintaining a food diary, or refer to community programs. 


## Other weight-loss approaches

- Note that lifestyle change is the most important factor for sustainable weight-loss success.

- Pharmacological interventions (together with lifestyle intervention). currently approved drugs in the U.S. include phentermine for short-term use (<3 months), and five obesity pharmacotherapies (orlistat, lorcaserin, phentemine-topiranate, naltrexone-bupropion, and liraglutide 3mg) that can be used longer. Note that regaining weight is common.

- Bariatric surgery. Even if it's more effective, it is associated with greater risks.


  
# Chr13: Considerations for Clients with Chronic Diseases

It's important for ACE-PT to identify and discuss health conditions before working with a client. Once identified, ACE-PT should decide if a client needs approval from a healthcare professional.


## Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disorders

- Cardonary artery disease (CAD, also called atherosclerotic heart disease).

Nutrition: A healthy diet pattern (5 primary and three secondary metrics): fruit and vegetables >4.5 cups/day, fish and shellfish >2 3.5 oz servings/week, sodium <1500 mg/day, sugar/sweetened beverages < 36fl oz/week, whole grains >3 1 oz servings/day; 1 oz of nuts and seed and 1/2 cup legumes >4 servings/week; processed meats < 2 1.75 0z servings/week, saturated fat <7% of total daily energy intake.  

Exercise: regular, moderate-intensity (40-80% HRR/VO2R or RPE OF 12/16 (6-20 scale) or add 20-30 bpm to RHR), physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week and muscle-strengthening activities on at least two days per week. It is most appropriate for PT to work with low-rish CAD clients (an uncomplicated clinical course, no evidence of resting or exercise-induced ischemia/arrhythmias, functionally capacity > 7 METs three weeks following any medical event, normal ventricular  function with an ejection fraction> 50%). 

- Hypertension

Risk factors include stress, body weight (especially excess body fat), and sleep, as well as age, excessive sodium intake, increased alcohol intake, and physical inactivity.

Treatment falls into nonpharmacological (lifestyle) interventions and pharmacological interventions. For lifestyle modification: weight reduction, adopt DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, to consume fiber and potassium via fruits, veggies, and whole grains, reduce intake of sodium, total and saturated fat, ...), dietary sodium reduction, physical activity, moderation of alcohol. For pharmacological interventions: be cautious that medications prescribed have a potential impact on the exercise and post-exercise response.

For exercise: most, but preferably all, days of the week, the intensity of 40-59% HRR or VO2R or RPE OF 12/13 (6-20 scale) or below VT1 can talk comfortably, with the goal of at least 30 minutes of continuous or accumulated exercise. 

- Stroke

Rehabilitation following stroke typically focuses on optimizing basic activities of daily living skills: regain balance, coordination, and functional independence, and prevent complications and reoccurrence. 

- Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)
  

## Metabolic Disorders:

- Dyslipidemia

Primary lipoprotein: low-density lipoprotein (LDL, 60-70% cholesterol, "bad" cholesterol for its role in atherogenesis), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL, 10-15% cholesterol, major carrier of triglyceride/TG), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL, similar to LDL), high low-density lipoprotein (HDL, 20-30% cholesterol, "good" cholesterol for its inverse correlation to CAD).

Table 13.7

Primary factors include genetics, sex, and age, along with secondary causes such as body-fat distribution, smoking, etc. 

Dietary recommendations focus specifically on lowering the LDL: consume a dietary pattern that emphasizes veggies, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, non-tropical veggies oils, and nuts; and limit intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. Aim for a dietary pattern that achieves 5-6% calories from saturated fat. reduce or eliminate the consumption of trans fat.

Successful exercise programs for degreasing total and LDL cholesterol generally involve 250-300 minutes each week, expending approx 2,000 calories, as long as the intensity is moderate to vigorous. 

- Type 1 Diabetes (insulin-dependent or juvenile-onset diabetes)
  
A person can develop type 1 diabetes at any age - being rapid in infants and children and slower in adults. When pancreatic beta cells are down to about 10% of their usual function, symptoms of hyperglycemia first appear. 

The blood glucose level should be measured before and after each exercise session. Before exercise, 70 mg/dL as a relative contraindication to an acute bout of exercise; consume up to 15 grams of carb before exercise if < 100 mg/dL; exercise should not exceed a moderate intensity if hyperglycemia is present (< 300mg/dL). 

An adjusted amount of insulin, typically reduce, injected should be considered for exercise. 

- Type 2 Diabetes (insulin-resistance)

Type 2 diabetes is largely related to lifestyle habits (physically inactive and/or sedentary lifestyle, excess caloric intake, and nutritional deficiencies) that promote insulin resistance and inflammation resulting in hyperglycemia.

Dietary improvements are a key component of managing body weight and blood glucose. 

All adults with diabetes or prediabetes should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity of 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio exercise per week. Avoiding going more than two days in a row without exercise is important for blood glucose management. 

- Metabolic Syndrome (MetS)

Mets is identified by the presence of three or more of the following: elevated waist circumference (men > 40 inches or 102 cm, women > 35 inches or 88 cm), reduced HDL cholesterol (men < 40 mg/dL or on DT, women < 50 mg/dL or on DT), elevated TG (>150 mg/dL or on DT), increased BP (>130/85 mmHG or on DT), elevated fasting blood glucose (>100 mg/dL or on DT).

The primary treatment for MetS is to reduce the risk of developing CVD and type 2 diabetes. Because many MetS also have obesity, the exercise program should be designed around guidelines for the treatment of clients with overweight or obese with additional factors of underlying CAD, hypertension, etc. 



## Pulmonary Disorders: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 

- Asthma

Approx 80% of people with asthma experience attacks during and/or after exercise (EIB, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction). Before starting an exercise program, a physician can provide guidance regarding potential triggers, medication use, and what to do in case of an asthmatic episode. Clients should have rescue medication with them all the time.

Individuals with asthma should be encouraged to perform a 10-15 minute warm-up. The intensity of exercise should be initially below VT1, 40-59% HRR, or 50-85% 1RM


## Other Chronic Conditions

- Cancer

- Osteoporosis (low bone bass and disrupted microarchitecture)

- Arthritis
