# Chr5: Preparticipation Health Screening

An exercise preparticipation health screen MUST be performed on ALL new participants, regardless of age, upon entering a facility that offers exercise equipment or service. The ACSM preparticipation guidelines are designed to remove any unnecessary barriers to becoming more physically active. 

## Inherent health risks and exercise

## Preparticipation Health Screening

ACSM preparticipation guidelines, mainly based on the three factors of current level of physical activity, diagnosed CV/metabolic/renal disease and/or presence of signs or symptoms, and the desired exercise intensity. The process is designed to identify three categories of those who should receive medical clearance before initiating the program or increasing exercise; those who have clinically significant diseases and may benefit from exercise; and those who medical conditions may require exclusion from the program. 

Note that identification of the signs/symptoms may be within the scope of practice, interpretation of those same signs/symptoms should be made only by qualified healthcare professionals. 

- For those who do not exercise regularly/:

- For self-guided screening: use Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+)

- Beta-blockers block beta-adrenergic receptors and limit sympathetic nervous system stimulation (block the effect of catecholamines, reduction in heart rate). The best way to monitor exercise intensity for who are on a beta block is to use rating of perceived exertion or the talk test versus the target heart rate.

- Calcium channel blockers lower blood pressure by preventing calcium-dependent contraction of the smooth muscles in the arteries.

- Diuretics are usually prescribed for high blood pressure by increasing the excretion of water and electrolytes through the kidneys. 




# Chr6: Nutrition for Health and Fitness

Outside the scope of a PT's practice includes practicing medical nutrition therapy (MNT), diagnosing nutrition-related conditions, prescribing a diet, and creating meal plans. 

Within: share general nonmedical nutrition info, recommend healthy eating patterns (Dietary Guidelines for Americans, updated every 5 years), recommend healthy food, ask questions, and encourage food journaling. Nutrient topics include principles of healthy nutrition and food preparation; food to be included in the balanced daily diet, essential daily nutrition, action of nutrients to the body, effect of deficiencies or excesses of nutrients, How nutrient requirements vary through the life cycle, principles of pre and post-workout nutrition and hydration, info about nutrients contained in foods or supplements. 

Ultimately, a PT's scope is determined by state policies and regulations, education and experience, and competencies and skills.

The level of intake of a nutrient that is adequate to meet the known needs of practically all healthy persons is referred to as the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA).

## Dietary Guidelines

1. follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage: veggies of all types (dark green veggies are highest in Vitamin K), fruits, grains (> half is whole, as whole grains contain 16 grams of whole grain per ounce-equivalent), dairy, protein food, and oils.

2.  Customize and enjoy food and beverage choices to reflect personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary considerations.

3.  Focus on meeting good food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and beverages, and stay within calorie limit. 

4. Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium, and limit alcoholic beverages.

Some facts: The general protein recommendation is 0.8-1 grams/kg (0.5 grams/lb) body weight per day. 

Any juice that is less than 100% fruit is considered a "sugary drink".

A high intake of saturated fat, as well as artificial trans fats, is associated with increased total and LDL cholesterol.

Individuals with hypertension are advised to follow the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan: low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat. The staples are whole grains, fruits, veggies, and beans, peas, and lentils.

## Food Labels

Operated by FDA. 

![IMG_1024](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/6f41aa24-7c04-4adf-b390-eeaba35536b4)

Aspects to be considered; serving size and serving per container, total calories, calories from fat/protein/carb, sugars (naturally occurring and added), sodium, fiber, trans fat, and ingredient list. 

Generally, fewer ingredients are better; no food label is possibly best of all, practice the habit of reading labels to increase awareness. 

Percent Daily Value is based on a 2,000-cal diet. 

Some calculation:

![IMG_1026](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/301c657d-15ec-4769-8c1f-0df50e4bb25b)

- Regulated term: allergen statement, health claims ("fiber maintains bowel regularity"), low sodium, reduced sodium, low fat, reduced fat. excellent source of fiber, fortification (added nutrient that is not contained naturally like Ca added to orange juice) vs. enrichment (added back nutrient that is lost during processing, like vitamin B added to white flour).  

- Unregulated terms: healthy, natural, nutritious, low-carb, contains.
  Eg. "natural flavor": an ingredient that contains naturally-derived chemicals, but could be comprised of 2-100 ingredients in itself;
  "Contains": has but not a lot

- Avoid added sugars (The intention is to increase awareness as many people inadvertently over-consume sugar, current dietary guidelines recommend <10% of total calories from added sugar). Here are common sources of hidden added sugar: condiments, cereals, granola, yogurt, sports drinks, protein bars, energy drinks, baked goods, crackers, chips, and sauces.  

- Not about good or bad, but more about self-awareness.
  

## Food Safety and selection

- Healthier swaps: granola to nuts, fruit bars to fruit, boxed rice to bulk rice, multi-grain bread to 100% whole wheat bread.
Decrease intake of saturated trans fat (solid fats) while increasing intake of unsaturated fats (oils). Limit total added sugar to less than 10% of total calories (most simple: do NOT drink calories).

- To reduce the risk of foodborne illness: check the produce for bruises and feel and smell for ripeness; look for a "sell-by" date for bread, a "use-by" date on packaged food, an "expiration date" on baking powder, and a "packaged date" on canned foods; separate fish and poultry from other products by wrapping separately; pick up refrigerated or frozen foods last. 


## Practical considerations

Plan meals for the week (fresh food early in the week and frozen/canned foods later); create a shopping list.

Don't shop when hungry, stick with the plan.

To help educate a client, the following is appropriate and within the scope of practice:: host grocery shopping tours, hold cooking demonstrations (meal[prep ideas), share evidence-based dietary guidelines, share MyPlate recommendations, share info about the types of foods to be included in a balanced daily diet, teach a client about the principles of healthy nutrient and food preparation.


## Fueling/Hydration before, during, and after exercise

![IMG_1025](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/49c10e3b-4902-4eac-8236-862492824d42)

In general, a pre-excise meal should be relatively high in carb to nax blood glucose availability, relatively low in fat and fiber to minimize GI distress, moderate in protein, around 400-800 calories, and well-tolerated by the individuals. 

Prevent a greater than 2% loss in body weight during exercise. Refueling should begin within 30 minutes after exercise.

On the day of an event, ab athletes should aim to eat a meal 4-6 hours before the event.


## Nutritional supplements

Because of non-regulation, supplements carry a risk of contamination or staining of harmful products or banned substances. Advise to get third-party verified product, but note that verification may assure safety, but not effectiveness

Note that older, female, and military tend to take supplements more than others. 

"ACE strongly advises against recommending supplementation and especially advises against selling dietary supplements as a personal trainer. "
