# Chr9: Muscular Training -  Foundations and Benefit

## Anatomical systems

- Skeletal system: 206 bones (compact or cortical bone - dense outer 75%, spongy or trabecular bone - inner structure).

Fig 9-1, 9-2

Axial skeleton (74) - central nervous system,  Appendicular skeleton (remaining 126), articulations - synovial joint (flexion, extension, abduction, adduction)

- Nervous system: central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS, somatic and autonomic)

- Muscular System: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle.

Table 9.4 to 9.11: Major muscles at the ankle, foot, knee, hip, spine, shoulder girdle, shoulder, elbow, radioulnar joints, wrist. 

Muscle function and muscle-fiber arrangement: longitudinal, unipennate, bipennate, multipennate. 

Ddecomposite: muscle >> bundles of muscle fibers surrounded by perimysium >> muscle fiber, endomysium - connective tissue surrounding individual muscle fibers)

Slow-twitch muscle fiber: type 1, contain a relatively large amount of mitochondria and higher concentrations of myoglobin >> resistant to fatigue and capable of sustaining aerobic metabolism.

Fast-twitch muscle fiber (type 2): TypeIIx or fast-glycolytic fibers >> contain a relatively small amount of mitochondria and limited aerobic metabolism; however possess a high number of glycolytic enzymes; TypeIIa or intermediate/fast oxidative glycolytic fibers >> speed, fatigue resistance, and force-production capabilities, for strength and power activities.


## Connective Tissue

"Cellular glue" that made up of dozens of proteins, including collagen. Collagen's physical properties are mainly tensile strength and inextensibility. Elastic fibers are made up of amino acids and are mainly responsible for determining the range of extensibility of muscle cells. 


## Human Motion Terminology

- Muscular action: static (isometric) action - balance and stabilization training; concentric (shortening) action; eccentric (lengthening action).

- Kinetic chain movement: closed-kinetic-chain exercises >> end of the chain is fixed such as squat, emphasize compression of joints; Open-kinetic-chain exercises >> end of the chain is free such as seated leg extension, involve more shearing forces at the joint.

- Mobility and stability: mobility - ankle, hip, thoracic spine, glenohumeral; stability - foot, knee, lumber pine, scapulothoracic.

- Balance and alignment: Center of gravity (COG), line of gravity, and base of support (BOS). 

  

## Benefit of Muscular Training

Increased physical capacity, enhanced metabolic function, reduced injury risk, and disease prevention.


## Physiological Adaptation to Muscular Training: Acute and Long-term

Two principal long-term physiological adaptations: increasing muscular strength (motor learning) and muscle size (hypertrophy; such as myofibrillar hypertrophy - increase in the number of myofibrils or contractile proteins).

Factors that influence muscular strength and hypertrophy: hormone levels, sex, age, muscle fiber type (slow-switch fibers activated at lower force levels and fast-switch fibers activated at higher forces levels, while typeII experience greater size increase), muscle length, limb length, tendon insertion point.


## Muscular Training Principles

Be aware of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS): exceptionally challenging training sessions are typically associated with several days of muscle fatigue and weakness, they may not lead to larger and stronger muscles. 

- progression: 1st and simplest method is to increase the number of repetitions with a given resistance (progressive repetitions -  increasing workload). A double-progression training protocol is suggested. eg. repeat time 12 increase to 15, then increase weight/workload %5 for 12 repeats, then 15 then 5% increase...

- Specificity: for achieving desired muscular-training objectives. Be aware to train all the major muscle groups and balance the training; use appropriate resistance-repetition protocols. 

- Overload: gradually adding more exercise resistance than the muscles have previously encountered. 

- Reversibility: reinforce the importance of muscular training as a lifestyle component. 

- Diminishing returns, esp strength plateau: to change the training exercise.


## Muscular Training Variables and Program Design

- Needs assessment

- Training frequency

- Exercise selection and order

- Training volume

- Training intensity

- Training Tempo

- Best intervals



## Components of a Muscular-Training Session.

- Warm-up: 5-10 minutes, lightweight, take into account all planes of motion. Focus on the movement patterns planned for the rest of the workout.

- Conditioning: frequency, duration, intensity, and modality. 

- Cool-down: stress reduction, return heart rate to resting levels, and initiate relation and the recovery process.
