# Chr5: Preparticipation Health Screening

An exercise preparticipation health screen MUST be performed on ALL new participants, regardless of age, upon entering a facility that offers exercise equipment or service. The ACSM preparticipation guidelines are designed to remove any unnecessary barriers to becoming more physically active. 

## Inherent health risks and exercise

## Preparticipation Health Screening

ACSM preparticipation guidelines, mainly based on the three factors of current level of physical activity, diagnosed CV/metabolic/renal disease and/or presence of signs or symptoms, and the desired exercise intensity. The process is designed to identify three categories of those who should receive medical clearance before initiating the program or increasing exercise; those who have clinically significant diseases and may benefit from exercise; and those who medical conditions may require exclusion from the program. 

Note that identification of the signs/symptoms may be within the scope of practice, interpretation of those same signs/symptoms should be made only by qualified healthcare professionals. 

- For those who do not exercise regularly/:

- Beta-blockers block beta-adrenergic receptors and limit sympathetic nervous system stimulation (block the effect of catecholamines, reduction in heart rate). The best way to monitor exercise intensity for who are on a beta block is to use rating of perceived exertion or the talk test versus the target heart rate.

- Calcium channel blockers lower blood pressure by preventing calcium-dependent contraction of the smooth muscles in the arteries.

- Diuretics are usually prescribed for high blood pressure by increasing the excretion of water and electrolytes through the kidneys. 




# Chr6: Nutrition for Health and Fitness

Outside the scope of personal trainer's practice includes practicing medical nutrition therapy (MNT), diagnosing nutrition-related conditions, prescribing a diet, creating meal plans

Within: recommend healthy eating patterns (Dietary Guidelines), recommend healthy food, ask questions, encourage food journaling


## Dietary Guidelines

The general protein recommendation is 0.8-1 grams/kg (0.5 grams/lb) body weight per day 

## Food Labels

TODO add figure

- Regulated term: allergen statement, health claims, low sodium, reduced sodium, low fat, reduced fat. excellent source of fiber, fortification (added nutrient that is not contained naturally ) vs. enrichment (added back nutrient that is lost during processing).  

- Unregulated terms: healthy, natural, nutritious, low-carb, contains.
  Eg. "natural flavor": an ingredient that contains naturally-derived chemicals, but could be comprised of 2-100 ingredients in itself;
  "Contains": has but not a lot
- Generally, fewer ingredients are better

- Avoid added sugars. Here are common sources of hidden added sugar: condiments, cereals, granola, yogurt, sports drinks, protein bars, energy drinks, baked goods, crackers, chips, and sauces.

- Not about good or bad, but more about self-awareness.
  

## Food Safety and selection

Healthier swaps: granola to nuts, fruit bars to fruit, boxed rice to bulk rice, multi-grain bread to 100% whole wheat bread.
Decrease intake of saturated trans fat (solid fats) while increasing intake of unsaturated fats (oils).
Limit total added sugar to less than 10$ of total calories (most simple: do NOT drink calories)


## Practical considerations

Plan meals for the week (fresh food early in the week and frozen/canned foods later); create a shopping list.

Don't shop when hungry, stick with the plan.


## Fueling before, during, and after exercise

## Fluid and hydration before, during, and after exercise.

prevent a greater than 2% loss in body weight during exercise


## Nutritional supplements

Note that older, female, and malitary tend to take supplements more than others. 

"ACE strongly advises against recommending supplementation and especially advise against selling dietary supplements as a personal trainer. "
