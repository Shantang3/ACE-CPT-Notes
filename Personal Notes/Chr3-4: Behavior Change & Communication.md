# Chr3: Basics of Behavior Change

## Behavioral Theory Model

### Health Belief Model

![IMG_0996](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/f05b2d0f-2e52-4a9d-a16e-372b0877cd70)

People's ideas and underlying emotions about illness, prevention, and treatments may influence health behaviors and decisions about changing (or not charging) health behaviors. At least 4 variables influence a person's decision to change:

- The belief in the health threat: perceived susceptibility to an illness (the likelihood), perceived seriousness (perception from health screen etc.).

- The perceptions/beliefs of the health behavior: benefits and barriers. 


### Self-determination Theory

Two basic types of motivation: autonomous motivation ("I want", intrinsic motivation as the highest level); and controlled motivation ("I need" by pressure from external forces). 
Ryan (2000) identified the needs as autonomy, competence, and relatedness to create an environment that supports intrinsic motivation. 

The importance of motivational climate in the exercise setting: task-involving (eg. by emphasizing process goals) is better than egO-involving (eg. by emphasizing outcome goals) climates. 

Don't forget social support strategies.


### Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM)


Refers to the individual's readiness for change, also called as states-of-change model:

1. Stages of changes: pre-contemplation (physically inactive and not even intending to begin due to no relevance or even discount of being physically active), contemplation (still inactive but are thinking about becoming more active in the near future; start to consider the importance but ambivalence exists), preparation (engagement in physical activity but can be inconsistent), action (engage in regular physical activity but less than 6 months), maintenance.

3. Processes of changes:

ABC approach: Ask powerful open-ended questions; Break down barriers; and Collaborate.

3. Self-efficacy: strongly related to program adoption and maintenance. There are 6 sources of it: past performance experience, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, physiological state appraisals, emotional state and mood appraisals, and/or imaginal experiences. 

4. Decisional Balance: evaluation of pros and cons of adopting and/or maintaining an activity program.

5. Lapse and Relapse: can occur at any stage of TTM.

In a real scenario: address the situation before it happens; collaborate on ways to stay active and other things such as dietary choices; enhance social support (e.g. contact out of the session).

Understand WILLPOWER - the ability to ignore temporary pleasure or discomfort to pursue a longer-term goal. It's a mind-body response, not a virtue. Note that willpower is inherently limited (Hagger 2010) - self-control depletes willpower in much the same way that exercise temporarily depletes physical power; thus planning in advance for moments of weak self-control is most likely to enhance willpower. 



## Principles of Behavior Change

### Operant condition

The process by which behaviors are influenced by their consequences (antecedents and consequences). The behavior chains and positive reinforcement (Positive reinforcement is best for PT to use to ensure that a desired client behavior will reoccur in the future).
 

### Cognitions and Behavior

![IMG_1002](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/ca9df68e-1357-4003-8131-0658e30eff02)

Replacing irrational thoughts, including jumping to conclusions, all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralizing, labeling, personalization and blame, magnification, and minimization; with healthier, more productive, and factual thinking. 

Goal setting and self-monitoring: SMART goal guidelines (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound). 



## Physical Activity and Adherence

Three categories of potential determinants for physical activity:

1. Personal attributes: demographic variables, health status, physical-activity history, psychological traits, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs.

2. Environmental factors: access to facilities, time, and social support.

Use stimulus control to make adjustments to the environment to increase the likelihood of healthy behaviors. E.g. gym between home and work, keeping a gym bag in the car, having workout clothes laid out for morning exercise, etc. 

Time as a potential barrier: encourage to change the perception through goal setting, time management, and prioritizing. Furthermore, PT should consider implementing time-efficient exercise sessions and collaborating about opportunities to be physically active throughout the day.

To promote social connectedness: find an enjoyable and reliable exercise partner, ask friends and family to be encouraging and positive, set up a "contest", and join a club. 

3. Physical-activity factors: intensity, injury,




# Chr4: Effective Communication, Goal Setting, and Teaching Techniques

This chapter mainly discussed the four stages of the client-personal trainer relationship: rapport, investigation, planning, action. 

## Rapport Stage

Built upon empathy and rapport, the personal trainer sets the scene for establishing mutual understanding and trust by considering:

- Cultural competence: age, gender, race, ethnicity, educational background, fitness level; beliefs, attitudes, values, and lifestyles ...

- First impression: to provide clients with a sense of caring, respect, clear communication, and professionalism.

- Verbal and non-verbal communication: voice quality, eye contact, facial expression, hand gestures, body position.

- Professional boundaries

- Dealing with difficult clients


## Investigation Stage

Rapport continues to build during this stage, with more personal information, like medical concerns, fitness assessment results, body weight, and exercise history.

- Gathing information: lifestyle and health history questionnaire; identify readiness for change; "what are you likes and dislikes when it comes to activity?"

- Active listening: empathetically listen while maintaining an open mind and be relevant 

- Motivational interviewing: employ a guiding style of communication with encouragement, support, and insists in the process of change; Use skills (such as sustain talk, importance ruler on a scale of 0 to 10), ABC approach, OARS (affirmation, reflection, listening, and summarizing), and righting reflex...
The spirit of motivational interviewing is composed of collaboration, acceptance, compassion, and evocation.

One example:

- Respond to difficult disclosure: often short response is all, ask if any change of training is needed; follow referral procedures if necessary. 


## Planning Stage

The relationship should be viewed as a give-and-take opportunity in terms of communication. PT should discuss their training method early, and explain the purpose of any physical contact, and ask for permission. 

- Setting goals: avoid too many goals or negative goals; set short- and long-term goals as well as performance goals; include clients in the process; revisit goals on a regular basis.

SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.

E.g. I want to exercise more > I will begin exercising by walking for 30 min at lunch on 3 or more days of the week.  I want to be healthier > I will take walk breaks for every 1 hour I sit at my desk on 5 days of the week. I want to "tune-up" > I will lift weights 3 days a week and practice yoga 2 days a week. 

- Generating ideas and discussing options.

- Formulating a plan

- Evaluating the exercise program.

## Action Stages

The program is a combination of exercises completed by clients on their own and exercises performed with the personal trainer instructing and supervising.

- Self-monitoring approaches: most effective to develop adherence; e.g. keeping an exercise journal.

- Effective teaching techniques: pay attention to stages of learning (associative - basic okay and ready for more specific feedback to refine the skills vs. autonomous), learning styles (a kinesthetic learner may prefer hands-on approaches and "feeling" movement), "tell, show, do" (at the cognitive stage of learning), providing feedback (positively rephrasing), and modeling.
