# Chr13: Considerations for Clients with Chronic Diseases

It's important for ACE-PT to identify and discuss health conditions before working with a client. Once identified, ACE-PT should decide if a client needs approval from a healthcare professional.


## Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disorders

- Cardonary artery disease (CAD, also called atherosclerotic heart disease).

Nutrition: A healthy diet pattern (5 primary and three secondary metrics): fruit and vegetables >4.5 cups/day, fish and shellfish >2 3.5 oz servings/week, sodium <1500 mg/day, sugar/sweetened beverages < 36fl oz/week, whole grains >3 1 oz servings/day; 1 oz of nuts and seed and 1/2 cup legumes >4 servings/week; processed meats < 2 1.75 0z servings/week, saturated fat <7% of total daily energy intake.  

Exercise: regular, moderate-intensity (40-80% HRR/VO2R or RPE OF 12/16 (6-20 scale) or add 20-30 bpm to RHR), physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week and muscle-strengthening activities on at least two days per week. It is most appropriate for PT to work with low-rish CAD clients (an uncomplicated clinical course, no evidence of resting or exercise-induced ischemia/arrhythmias, functionally capacity > 7 METs three weeks following any medical event, normal ventricular  function with an ejection fraction> 50%). 

- Hypertension

Risk factors include stress, body weight (especially excess body fat), and sleep, as well as age, excessive sodium intake, increased alcohol intake, and physical inactivity.

Treatment falls into nonpharmacological (lifestyle) interventions and pharmacological interventions. For lifestyle modification: weight reduction, adopt DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, to consume fiber and potassium via fruits, veggies, and whole grains, reduce intake of sodium, total and saturated fat, ...), dietary sodium reduction, physical activity, moderation of alcohol. For pharmacological interventions: be cautious that medications prescribed have a potential impact on the exercise and post-exercise response.

For exercise: most, but preferably all, days of the week, the intensity of 40-59% HRR or VO2R or RPE OF 12/13 (6-20 scale) or below VT1 can talk comfortably, with the goal of at least 30 minutes of continuous or accumulated exercise. 

- Stroke

Rehabilitation following stroke typically focuses on optimizing basic activities of daily living skills: regain balance, coordination, and functional independence, and prevent complications and reoccurrence. 

- Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)
  

## Metabolic Disorders:

- Dyslipidemia

Primary lipoprotein: low-density lipoprotein (LDL, 60-70% cholesterol, "bad" cholesterol for its role in atherogenesis), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL, 10-15% cholesterol, major carrier of triglyceride/TG), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL, similar to LDL), high low-density lipoprotein (HDL, 20-30% cholesterol, "good" cholesterol for its inverse correlation to CAD).

Table 13.7

Primary factors include genetics, sex, and age, along with secondary causes such as body-fat distribution, smoking, etc. 

Dietary recommendations focus specifically on lowering the LDL: consume a dietary pattern that emphasizes veggies, fruits, and whole grains; includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, non-tropical veggies oils, and nuts; and limit intake of sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and red meats. Aim for a dietary pattern that achieves 5-6% calories from saturated fat. reduce or eliminate the consumption of trans fat.

Successful exercise programs for degreasing total and LDL cholesterol generally involve 250-300 minutes each week, expending approx 2,000 calories, as long as the intensity is moderate to vigorous. 

- Type 1 Diabetes (insulin-dependent or juvenile-onset diabetes)
  
A person can develop type 1 diabetes at any age - being rapid in infants and children and slower in adults. When pancreatic beta cells are down to about 10% of their usual function, symptoms of hyperglycemia first appear. 

The blood glucose level should be measured before and after each exercise session. Before exercise, 70 mg/dL as a relative contraindication to an acute bout of exercise; consume up to 15 grams of carb before exercise if < 100 mg/dL; exercise should not exceed a moderate intensity if hyperglycemia is present (< 300mg/dL). 

An adjusted amount of insulin, typically reduce, injected should be considered for exercise. 

- Type 2 Diabetes (insulin-resistance)

Type 2 diabetes is largely related to lifestyle habits (physically inactive and/or sedentary lifestyle, excess caloric intake, and nutritional deficiencies) that promote insulin resistance and inflammation resulting in hyperglycemia.

Dietary improvements are a key component of managing body weight and blood glucose. 

All adults with diabetes or prediabetes should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity of 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio exercise per week. Avoiding going more than two days in a row without exercise is important for blood glucose management. 

- Metabolic Syndrome (MetS)

Mets is identified by the presence of three or more of the following: elevated waist circumference (men > 40 inches or 102 cm, women > 35 inches or 88 cm), reduced HDL cholesterol (men < 40 mg/dL or on DT, women < 50 mg/dL or on DT), elevated TG (>150 mg/dL or on DT), increased BP (>130/85 mmHG or on DT), elevated fasting blood glucose (>100 mg/dL or on DT).

The primary treatment for MetS is to reduce the risk of developing CVD and type 2 diabetes. Because many MetS also have obesity, the exercise program should be designed around guidelines for the treatment of clients with overweight or obese with additional factors of underlying CAD, hypertension, etc. 



## Pulmonary Disorders: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 

- Asthma

Approx 80% of people with asthma experience attacks during and/or after exercise (EIB, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction). Before starting an exercise program, a physician can provide guidance regarding potential triggers, medication use, and what to do in case of an asthmatic episode. Clients should have rescue medication with them all the time.

Individuals with asthma should be encouraged to perform a 10-15 minute warm-up. The intensity of exercise should be initially below VT1, 40-59% HRR, or 50-85% 1RM


## Other Chronic Conditions

- Cancer

- Osteoporosis (low bone bass and disrupted microarchitecture)

- Arthritis
