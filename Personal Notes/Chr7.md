# Chr7: Resting Assessments and Anthropometric Measurements

## Sequencing Assessment

- Resting vital signs: heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), height, and weight.

- Static posture and movement assessment (Chr10). 

- Joint flexibility and muscle length (Chr10).

- Balance and core function (Chr10).

- Cardiorespiratory fitness (Chr8).

- Body composition and anthropometry.

- Muscular fitness (endurance and strength) (Chr10).

- Skill-related parameters (agility, coordination, power, reactivity, and speed) (Chr10).

## Cardiovascular Assessment at Rest

- Resting HR (RHR): Sinus bradycardia (slow HR): RHR < 60 bpm; Normal sinus rhythm: RHR 60 â€“ 100 bmp; Sinus tacgycardia: RHR > 100 bpm. Females might have lower RHR. 

One of the possible over-training indicators: 5 mpm higher in RHR than normal. 

- Blood pressure (BP): systolic BP (SBP): higher number and represents the pressure created by the heart as it pumps blood into circulation via ventricular contraction; diastolic BP (DBP): lower number. 

(SBP and/or DBP in mmHg) Normal: <120 and <80; Elevated: 120-129 and < 80; Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139 or 80-89; Stage 2 hypertension: >=140 or >=90 


## Anthropometric Measurements and Body Composition

- Lean body mass: muscle, connective tissue, bones, blood, nervous tissue, skin, and organs.

- Essential body fat: insulation, thermoregulation, hormone production, cushioning of vital organs, and maintenance of certain body functions. Men 2-5%, women 10-13%.

- Subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

Main common and practical methods: Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, Skinfold Measurement (assume 50% of body fat lies under the skin), and Anthropometric Measurement.

Expected change and time: in 2-3 months, reduce  body fat by 2.7-5.9% or waist circumference by 1.9-3.3 cm. 


## Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index

BMI = Weight(kg) / Height(m)^2 or 703* Weight (lb)/Height(in)^2

## Circumference Measurement

TODO: TWO tables

- Waist circumference

- Waist-to-hip ratio
