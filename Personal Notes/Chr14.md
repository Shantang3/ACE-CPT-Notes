# Chr14 Exercise Considerations across the Lifespan

## Exercise and Youth

Understand the child and their interest and motivations; muscle-strengthening activities don't have to be structured, but can instead be incorporated into play and games. 

Children have different risk factors than adults: the epiphyseal plate, or growth plate, is a cartilaginous area of the bone that is not fully formed in youth - improper form, repetitive impact, and torque may increase the risk of injury. Never encourage children to perform single maximal lifts or sudden explosive movements. Overuse injuries and sports-related traumatic injuries occur due to increase in "sport specialization" and year-round single-sport play. A PT must also remember the principles of periodization.

Table 14-1.


## Exercise for Women during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period

- Pregnancy

It is important that PTs request medical clearance from a physician if the woman also has obstetric or medical comorbidities such as severe obesity, gestational diabetes, or hypertension. Current recommendations support moderate-intensity exercise for at least 140 minutes three days per week during normal pregnancy. 

Women undergo a variety of physical changes during pregnancy that must be considered. Gaining 25-35 lbs is recommended. Woman's COG moves upward and forward > low-back discomfort and affects balance and coordination > A focus early in pregnancy on increased posterior leg and trunk strength through properly performed squat, lunge, and deadlift exercise programming. An increase in the hormone relaxin will increase joint laxity, women may see a flare-up of an old injury or simply feel more discomfort due to joint instability. A cardiac reserve is reduced in pregnant women (early month increases in heart rate, blood column, stroke volume, and cardiac output > allow for increased rest periods). 20 weeks of gestation, maintaining a supine position may cause decreased venous return > hypertension.

If any of the following happened, the exercise session should be postponed and the client should discuss with a physician first: vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, regular painful contractions, amniotic fluid exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, and muscle weakness. 

- Postpartum

For the woman who wishes to resume exercise shortly after delivery: obtain physician clearance and guidelines first; begin slowly and gradually increase duration, frequency, and intensity; exercise to strengthen major groups; drink plenty of water. It is essential to take into consideration a healing C-section or the presence of diastasis recti. 

Exercise for diastasis recti: quadruped transverse abdominal isometric contraction. wide-stance squats with dumbbells, bridges (with a yoga block between tighs), bent-knee, alternate-leg heel taps (death bugs), bird dog. 


## Exercise for Older Adults

Physiological results of aging include a decline in fitness levels, loss of height, reduced lean body bass, loss of skin and connective tissue elasticity, slower healing, changes in eyesight, and reduced coordination. 

Recommendation: participate in exercise at the same level as other adults, performing moderate-intensity cardio for a minimum of 150 to 400 minutes each week or vigorous-intensity cardio for 75-150 minutes per week. However, be cautious about chronic diseases such as arthritis. Balance training is recommended. 


# Chr15: Considerations for Clients with Musculoskeletal Issues

## Common Injuries and Reactions to Healing

- Acute and Chronic injuries: the physiology of healing

Phase I - inflammation (3-4 days after injury): implement RICE (rest or restricted activity, ice, compression, and elevation). Phase II - repair (may overlap with inflammation and last approx 6 weeks). Phase III - remodeling (overlaps with repair at about 3-6 weeks post-injury; healing, especially of ligament and bone, can last 1-2 years). 

#### Common Acute Injuries
- Muscle strains: tears of the muscle fibers due to work beyond capacity.

- Ligament sprains: more frequently occur as pressure to stretch the ligament. e.g. ACL (anterior cruciate ligament).

- Cartilage Damage: compression of the joint coupled with a shearing motion > joint stiffness, clicking or popping with weight-bearing activities, joint pain.

- Bone fractures; Head, neck and back injuries:
   
#### Common Overuse Conditions

- Tendinities
