# Chr7: Resting Assessments and Anthropometric Measurements

![IMG_1027](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/a18e11cf-001f-4322-bc57-26ba6870f8c6)

## Sequencing Assessment

- Resting vital signs: heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), height, and weight.

- Static posture and movement assessment (Chr10). 

- Joint flexibility and muscle length (Chr10).

- Balance and core function (Chr10).

- Cardiorespiratory fitness (Chr8).

- Body composition and anthropometry.

- Muscular fitness (endurance and strength) (Chr10).

- Skill-related parameters (agility, coordination, power, reactivity, and speed) (Chr10).

TODO: add table 7.1


## Cardiovascular Assessment at Rest

- Resting HR (RHR): Sinus bradycardia (slow HR): RHR < 60 bpm; Normal sinus rhythm: RHR 60 â€“ 100 bmp; Sinus tacgycardia: RHR > 100 bpm. Females might have lower RHR. 

One of the possible over-training indicators: 5 mpm higher in RHR than normal. 

- Blood pressure (BP): systolic BP (SBP): higher number and represents the pressure created by the heart as it pumps blood into circulation via ventricular contraction; diastolic BP (DBP): lower number.

(SBP and/or DBP in mmHg) Normal: <120 and <80; Elevated: 120-129 and < 80; Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139 or 80-89; Stage 2 hypertension: >=140 or >=90 


## Anthropometric Measurements and Body Composition

- Lean body mass: muscle, connective tissue, bones, blood, nervous tissue, skin, and organs.

- Essential body fat: insulation, thermoregulation, hormone production, cushioning of vital organs, and maintenance of certain body functions. Men 2-5%, women 10-13%.

- Subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

Main common and practical methods: Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, Skinfold Measurement (assume 50% of body fat lies under the skin), and Anthropometric Measurement.

Expected change and time: in 2-3 months, reduce  body fat by 2.7-5.9% or waist circumference by 1.9-3.3 cm. 


## Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index

BMI = Weight(kg) / Height(m)^2 or 703* Weight (lb)/Height(in)^2

- Waist circumference

- Waist-to-hip ratio

# Chr11: Intergrated Exercise Programming: from Evidence to Practice

## Evidence-based Practice (EBP)

Formulate (a question) > search (for health and fitness research evidence) > scrutinize (the quality of research evidence) 
> incorporate (the evidence into program design and implementation) > evaluate (outcomes) > formulate again > ...

## ACE IFT Model Cardio Training Program 

## ACE IFT Muscular Traning program

? repeated 

- Funtional training covers some core stablillization, Flexibility exercise

- Load/Speed Training covers some plyometrics for the lower and uper body

Movement pattern: linear forward > lateral > backpadel > rotational > crossover cutting curving

Lower body: jump in place, jumping jacks, alternating push-ff, single linear jump, standing long/vertical jump, multiple linear jumps,
front/lateral cone jump, multidirecctional jump, hexagon drill, diagonal cone jump ...

Upper body: power push-ups, medicine ball power push ups, horizontal chest pass, supine vertical chest toss...

Speed drills: arm squeeze and rear/forward arm drive, ABC (high knee, high marches, butt kicks) drills ...

agility-ladder/hurdke drills: forward/lateral jumps/hops, backpedal, multidirectional; katerak shuffles, pro agility drill ...



## Periodization

interntionally varies the training stimuli, especially with respect to intensity and volumn (resistance, repitition, and sets).
Divided into time segments and macrocycles (6-12 months as program timeframe), mesocycle (as specific training goals) and 
microcycles (as progressive training segment for each mesocycle).
Performed in either linear manner (consistent protocol) or undulating approach (different training protocol).



## Program Maitainance 

Srategy #1: minimum dose of activity to maitain weight and cardio health quates to 1-mile per day.

Strategy #2: low dose HIIT (12min/weel) improve cardio health.

Strategy #3: intergrate a single long training session into the biweekly training routine.

Strategy #4: combined cardio and muscular training is an antidote to detraining. 


## Recovery

Frequency, intensity, time/duration, type between bouts (active or passitive).

Applications: program active recovery (supeior to passive recovery); program specific recovery intensities, program giit
