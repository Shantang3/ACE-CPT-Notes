# Chr8: Cardiorespiratory Training: Physiology, Assessments, and Programming

## Anatomical System

- Cardiorespiratory system: The categories of blood vessels: arteries and arterioles (carry blood from the heart); capillaries; venules and veins (return blood to the heart).

- Respiratory system



## Physiology of Cardiorespiratory System

- Oxygen-carrying capacity: the ability to adequately ventilate the alveoli in the lungs (pulmonary ventilation: rate and depth of breathing – tidal volume), the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the blood.

- Oxygen Delivery: 

Cardiac output = HR * SV (stroke volume): at rest average 5 liters/min; during maximal exercise 20-25 and can rise to 30-40 liters/min.

- Oxygen extraction: aerobic production of ATP in the mitochondria, depends on the muscle-fiber type and availability of specialized oxidative enzymes. 


## Physiological Adaptations to Acute and Chronic Cardiorespiratory Exercise

- Muscular system: low-intensity endurance exercise – type 1 (slow-twitch) muscle fibers – size and number of mitochondria – hypertrophy; high-intensity exercise – type 2 (fast-twitch) muscle fibers – number of anaerobic enzymes.

- Cardiovascular system: larger SV, as maximal HR (MHR) does not increase with training.

- Time required for increases in cardiorespiratory fitness: Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max, standard marker of cardio) – increases with training but plateaus about 6 months; ventilatory threshold (VT, an important marker of metabolism, permits prediction of lactate threshold) – change continue for years, as capillary growth and increased mitochondrial density.

- Physiological adaptations to steady-state and interval-based exercise: Exercise duration is primarily limited by the willingness to continue or by the availability of O2, muscle glycogen, and/or blood glucose.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) promotes similar or greater improvements in VO2 max and fitness than steady-state exercise.


## Environmental Consideration

Body-temperature regulation: heat gain (metabolic heat, environmental heat, radiation, conduction, convection) vs. heat loss (radiation, conduction, convection, evaporation). 

- When exercising in the heat, be cautious about heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
  
- When exercising in the code, be cautious about hypothermia and/or frostbite.

- Exercising at higher altitudes: altitude sickness. Usually two weeks of acclimatization (3rd day worst).

- Exercising in air pollution: 


## General Guidelines

TODO: add table 8.4

- Frequency recommendation: moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise: minimum 5 days per week; or vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise: minimum 3 days per week; or combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise: 3 -5 days per week.

- Intensity: by HR, Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), VO2 or metabolic equivalents (METs), caloric expenditure, talk test and HR at 1st ventilatory threshold (VT1), blood lactate and HR at VT2, etc. 

Maximal HR (MHR) = (220-AGE) with 12 bmp standard deviations (Fox, Naughton, Haskell); MHR = 206.9 - 0.69 * Age (Gellish); influenced by genetics, exercise modality, medications, body size (usually higher in smaller individuals), altitude, age (generally decreases by 1-bpm each year)

Targeted HR (THR) = HRR * %intensity + RHR, where HRR=MHR-RHR

Table 8.8 MET

- Duration (time)

- Type: equipment-based cardio exercise, circuit training, outdoor exercise, water exercise

- Exercise progression: SAID principle: specific adaptation to imposed demands

- A FITT for reducing sedentary time: frequency (break every 1-2 hours) - intensity (light-intensity during break) - time (avoid 2-hour setting and 5-10 min break) - type (light-intensity such as household task.



## Assessments



## Components of a Cardiorespiratory Workout Session

- Warm-up: 5-10 minutes with low- to moderate intensity.

- Conditioning Phase: consider frequency, duration, intensity, and modality. Higher-intensity elements should take place fairly early and conclude with more steady-state exercise. Interval training generally involves hours of steady-state exercise performed at a higher intensity for sustained periods, followed by a lower cardio intensity for the recovery interval, with exercise-to-recovery ratios between 1:3 to 1:1.

- Cool-down: the same duration and intensity as a warm-up. a stretching routine followed by a cool-down may improve flexibility. 


## ACE Integrated Fitness Training Model

TABLE 8-11

- Base training: establishing consistent exercise participation, with relatively low- to moderate-intensity exercise of only moderate duration, to establish a cardio base.

- Program Design: help clients have positive experiences with exercise. General principle: begin with zone-1 intensity exercise with HR below VT1 performed for as little as 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times each week. However, this should be progressed as rapidly as tolerated to at least 20 minutes at moderate intensity.

- Fitness training:
- 
- Performance Training: for clients who have endurance-performance objectives and/or competitive endurance goals. Focus on anaerobic ppwer
