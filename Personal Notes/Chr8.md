# Chr8: Cardiorespiratory Training: Physiology, Assessments, and Programming

## Anatomical System

- Cardiorespiratory system: The categories of blood vessels: arteries and arterioles (carry blood from the heart); capillaries; venules and veins (return blood to the heart).

- Respiratory system



## Physiology of Cardiorespiratory System

- Oxygen-carrying capacity: the ability to adequately ventilate the alveoli in the lungs (pulmonary ventilation: rate and depth of breathing – tidal volume), the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the blood.

- Oxygen Delivery: 

Cardiac output = HR * SV (stroke volume): at rest average 5 liters/min; during maximal exercise 20-25 and can rise to 30-40 liters/min.

- Oxygen extraction: aerobic production of ATP in the mitochondria, depends on the muscle-fiber type and availability of specialized oxidative enzymes.

## Physiological Adaptations to Acute and Chronic Cardiorespiratory Exercise

- Muscular system: low-intensity endurance exercise – type 1 (slow-twitch) muscle fibers – size and number of mitochondria – hypertrophy; high-intensity exercise – type 2 (fast-twitch) muscle fibers – number of anaerobic enzymes.

- Cardiovascular system: larger SV, as maximal HR (MHR) does not increase with training.

- Time required for increases in cardiorespiratory fitness: Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max, standard marker of cardio) – increases with training but plateaus about 6 months; ventilatory threshold (VT, an important marker of metabolism, permits prediction of lactate threshold) – change continue for years, as capillary growth and increased mitochondrial density.

- Physiological adaptations to steady-state and interval-based exercise: Exercise duration is primarily limited by the willingness to continue or by the availability of O2, muscle glycogen, and/or blood glucose.

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) promotes similar or greater improvements in VO2 max and fitness than steady-state exercise.


## Environmental Consideration

Body-temperature regulation: heat gain (metabolic heat, environmental heat, radiation, conduction, convection) vs. heat loss (radiation, conduction, convection, evaporation).

- When exercising in the heat, be cautious about heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

- When exercising in the cold, be cautious about hypothermia and/or frostbite.

- Exercising at higher altitudes: altitude sickness. Usually two weeks of acclimatization (3rd day worst).

- Exercising in air pollution: 


## General Guidelines

![IMG_1037](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/aca90de9-9dcd-4572-935b-8e9ec10227b6)

- Frequency recommendation: moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise: minimum 5 days per week; or vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise: minimum 3 days per week; or combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise: 3 -5 days per week.

![IMG_1038](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/38edd3d0-85d2-4b60-a285-13ca00ce1774)

- Intensity: by HR, Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), VO2 or metabolic equivalents (METs), caloric expenditure, talk test and HR at 1st ventilatory threshold (VT1), blood lactate and HR at VT2, etc. 

* Maximal HR (MHR) = (220-AGE) with 12 bmp standard deviations (Fox, Naughton, Haskell); MHR = 206.9 - 0.69 * Age (Gellish); influenced by genetics, exercise modality, medications, body size (usually higher in smaller individuals), altitude, age (generally decreases by 1-bpm each year)

* Targeted HR (THR) = HRR * %intensity + RHR, where HRR=MHR-RHR

* VO2 and metabolic equivalent: minimal improvement in VO2 max threshold: 40/50% of VO2 max and VO2R

* Caloric expenditure

* VT1 and VT2: talk comfortably below VT1 in zone 1; cannot talk comfortably avove V2 in some . 

- Duration (time)

- Type: equipment-based cardio exercise, circuit training, outdoor exercise, water exercise

- Exercise progression: SAID principle: specific adaptation to imposed demands

- A FITT for reducing sedentary time: frequency (break every 1-2 hours) - intensity (light-intensity during break) - time (avoid 2-hour setting and 5-10 min break) - type (light-intensity such as household task.

## Assessments

- Ventilatory threshold assessment: VT1 for 1-2 hours of exercise; VT2 for 30-60 minutes for well-trained individuals.

- Talk test: simple questions or counting numbers during the expiration phase of one breath (70% as normal: VT1)

- Submaximal talk test for VT1: HR telemetry for continuous monitoring for 5-bpm increase to measure HR response at VT1 by increasing exercise intensity.\

- VT2 threshold (onset of blood lactate accumulation OBLA): 10-mile time run or 30 minutes to estimate HR at VT2.

## Components of a Cardiorespiratory Workout Session

- Warm-up: 5-10 minutes with low- to moderate intensity.

- Conditioning Phase: consider frequency, duration, intensity, and modality. Higher-intensity elements should take place fairly early and conclude with more steady-state exercise. Interval training generally involves hours of steady-state exercise performed at a higher intensity for sustained periods, followed by a lower cardio intensity for the recovery interval, with exercise-to-recovery ratios between 1:3 to 1:1.

- Cool-down: the same duration and intensity as a warm-up. a stretching routine followed by a cool-down may improve flexibility. 


## ACE Integrated Fitness Training Model

TABLE 8-11

- Base training: establishing consistent exercise participation, with relatively low- to moderate-intensity exercise of only moderate duration, to establish a cardio base.

- Program Design: help clients have positive experiences with exercise. General principle: begin with zone-1 intensity exercise with HR below VT1 performed for as little as 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times each week. However, this should be progressed as rapidly as tolerated to at least 20 minutes at moderate intensity.

- Fitness training:
- 
- Performance Training: for clients who have endurance-performance objectives and/or competitive endurance goals. Focus on anaerobic ppwer
