## Important Legal Forms

- Agreements to participate: typically not a formal contract, but rather a demonstration that the client was made aware of "normal" outcomes of certain physical activities and willingly assumed the risks of participation.

- Informed consent: A client acknowledges that they have been specifically informed of the risks associated with the activity. 
Should detail the possible discomforts and potential alternatives: purpose and explanation of the test, Risks, Benefits to be expected and alternatives available, Confidentiality and use of information; Inquiries and freedom of consent.

- Waivers: as a properly worded exculpatory clause bars the injured party from potential recovery. Note that each state has slightly different rules regarding the validity of waivers.
Waivers also must detail the types of activities and potential risks of injury that would be barred from recovering remuneration in a court of law.
Waivers also typically do not protect the PT from injuries directly caused by gross negligence.

Mist insurance agents now recommend that all professionals purchase an umbrella liability policy.
