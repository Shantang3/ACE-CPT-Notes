# Chr7: Resting Assessments and Anthropometric Measurements

## Sequencing Assessment

- Resting vital signs: heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), height, and weight.

- Static posture and movement assessment (Chr10). 

- Joint flexibility and muscle length (Chr10).

- Balance and core function (Chr10).

- Cardiorespiratory fitness (Chr8).

- Body composition and anthropometry.

- Muscular fitness (endurance and strength) (Chr10).

- Skill-related parameters (agility, coordination, power, reactivity, and speed) (Chr10).

Note that not all clients need or desire a full fitness assessment as they come with a unique set of goals (flexibility, endurance, weight loss, etc.), likes, dislikes, and skills. This should be considered when selecting and sequencing the assessment. Usually, assessments should be conducted only after the preparticipation health screening and initial interview. Conducting resting measurements is useful, but it may not be necessary to conduct a full body-composition assessment. 


## Cardiovascular Assessment at Rest

- Resting HR (RHR, commonly measured by radial and carotid arteries - not push too hard): Sinus bradycardia (slow HR): RHR < 60 bpm; Normal sinus rhythm: RHR 60 â€“ 100 bmp; Sinus tachycardia: RHR > 100 bpm. Females might have lower RHR (average 60-70 for males, 72-80 for females). RHR is affected by position, digestion, fitness, fatigue, genetics, body composition, drugs and medication, alcohol, caffeine, stress, etc.

Heart Rate is a valid indicator of work intensity or stress during the exercise. One of the possible over-training indicators: 5 mpm higher in RHR than normal. 

- Blood pressure (BP, right arm): systolic BP (SBP) - higher number and represents the pressure created by the heart as it pumps blood into circulation via ventricular contraction; diastolic BP (DBP) - lower number.

(SBP and/or DBP in mmHg) Normal: <120 and <80; Elevated: 120-129 and < 80; Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139 or 80-89; Stage 2 hypertension: >=140 or >=90.

If an abnormal BP reading is discovered, either at rest or during exercise, it is prudent to recommend visiting a personal physician. 


## Anthropometric Measurements and Body Composition

- Lean body mass: muscle, connective tissue, bones, blood, nervous tissue, skin, and organs.

- Essential body fat: insulation, thermoregulation, hormone production, cushioning of vital organs, and maintenance of certain body functions. Men 2-5%, women 10-13%.

- Subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

Main common and practical methods: Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (affected by skin thickness, hydration, ambient and skin temperatures, exercise or alcohol consumption), Skinfold Measurement (assume 50% of body fat lies under the skin; not optimal or even appropriate choice for clients with obesity), and Anthropometric Measurement. 

Expected change and time: in 2-3 months, reduce body fat by 2.7-5.9% or waist circumference by 1.9-3.3 cm. 


## Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index

BMI = Weight(kg) / Height(m)^2 or 703* Weight (lb)/Height(in)^2. 

BMI does NOT estimate actual body composition, and thus can incorrectly categorize some individuals. Only using it might be inaccurate. For extremely muscular individuals, MBI may incorrectly categorize.

## Circumference Measurement

Note that it does not assess body composition or obesity but rather body size or dimensions. Thus sometimes a good predictor of health problems. E.g. For a client who has extreme obesity, some assessments will be inaccurate. In such cases, only using BMI or circumference measurements may be more appropriate.

- Waist circumference

- Waist-to-hip ratio
