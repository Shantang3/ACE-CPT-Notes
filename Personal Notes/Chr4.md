# Chr4: Effective Communication, Goal Setting, and Teaching Techniques

This chapter mainly discussed the four stages of the client-personal trainer relationship

## Rapport Stage

Built upon empathy and rapport, the personal trainer sets the scene for establishing mutual understanding and trust by considering:

- Cultural competence: age, gender, race, ethnicity, educational background, fitness level; beliefs, attitudes, values, and lifestyles ...

- First impression: to provide clients with a sense of caring, respect, clear communication, and professionalism.

- Verbal and non-verbal communication: voice quality, eye contact, facial expression, hand gestures, body position.

- Professional boundaries

- Dealing with difficult clients


## Investigation Stage.

Rapport continues to build during this stage, with more personal information, like medical concerns, fitness-assessment results, body weight, and exercise history.

- Gathing information: lifestyle and health history questionnaire.

- Active listening

- Motivational interviewing: use skills such as sustain talk, ABC approach, OARS (affirmation, reflective, listening and summarizing), righting reflex...
The spirit of motivational interviewing is composed of collaboration, acceptance, compassion, and evocation.

- Respond to difficult disclosure; follow referral procedures if necessary. 


## Planning Stage

The relationship should be viewed as a give-and-take opportunity in terms of communication:

- Setting goals: avoid too many goals or negative goals; set short- and long-term goals as well as performance goals; include clients in the process; revisit goals on a regular basis.

SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.

- Generating ideas and discussing options.

- Formulating a plan

- Evaluating the exercise program.


## Action Stages

The program is a combination of exercises completed by clients on their own and exercises performed with the personal trainer instructing and supervising.

- Self-monitoring approaches

- Effective teaching techniques: pay attention to stages of learning (associative vs. autonomous), learning styles, "tell, show, do", providing feedback, modeling
