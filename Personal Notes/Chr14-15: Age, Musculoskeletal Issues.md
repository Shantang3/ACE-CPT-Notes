# Chr14 Exercise Considerations across the Lifespan

## Exercise and Youth

Understand the child and their interest and motivations; muscle-strengthening (build bone density) activities don't have to be structured, but can instead be incorporated into play and games. 

Children have different risk factors than adults: the epiphyseal plate, or growth plate, is a cartilaginous area of the bone that is not fully formed in youth - improper form, repetitive impact, and torque may increase the risk of injury. Never encourage children to perform single maximal lifts or sudden explosive movements. Overuse injuries and sports-related traumatic injuries occur due to an increase in "sport specialization" and year-round single-sport play. A PT must also remember the principles of periodization.

Children might be at greater risk of heat-related illness than adults: higher ratio of body surface to mass, lower exercise economy, diminished sweating capacity, and lower cardiac output. 

## Exercise for Women during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period

- Pregnancy

It is important that PTs request medical clearance from a physician if the woman also has obstetric or medical comorbidities such as severe obesity, gestational diabetes, or hypertension. Current recommendations support moderate-intensity exercise for at least 140 minutes three days per week during normal pregnancy. 

![IMG_1147](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/5e5ed5b9-1746-46af-ae84-780a16d6da5f)

Women undergo a variety of physical changes during pregnancy that must be considered. Gaining 25-35 lbs is recommended. Woman's COG moves upward and forward > low-back discomfort and affects balance and coordination > A focus early in pregnancy on increased posterior leg and trunk strength through properly performed squat, lunge, and deadlift exercise programming. An increase in the hormone relaxin will increase joint laxity, women may see a flare-up of an old injury or simply feel more discomfort due to joint instability. A cardiac reserve is reduced in pregnant women (early month increases in heart rate, blood column, stroke volume, and cardiac output > allow for increased rest periods). 20 weeks of gestation, maintaining a supine position may cause decreased venous return > hypertension.


To consider: risk of preterm labor, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, premature labor, rupture of membranes, or severe anemia. If any of the following happened, the exercise session should be postponed and the client should discuss with a physician first: vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, regular painful contractions, amniotic fluid exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, and muscle weakness. 

A focus early in the pregnancy on posterior leg and trunk strength can help ready for the increased weight and change in COG.

- Postpartum

For the woman who wishes to resume exercise shortly after delivery: obtain physician clearance and guidelines first; begin slowly and gradually increase duration, frequency, and intensity; exercise to strengthen major groups; drink plenty of water. It is essential to take into consideration a healing C-section or the presence of diastasis recti. 

To consider: shifting hormone levels, fatigue, postpartum anemia, and diastasis recti or healing of C-section incision. 

Exercise for diastasis recti: quadruped transverse abdominal isometric contraction. wide-stance squats with dumbbells, bridges (with a yoga block between tighs), bent-knee, alternate-leg heel taps (death bugs), bird dog. 


## Exercise for Older Adults

Physiological results of aging include a decline in fitness levels, loss of height, reduced lean body bass, loss of skin and connective tissue elasticity, slower healing, changes in eyesight, and reduced coordination. 

Conducting posture and flexibility assessment before movement assessment is especially important, considering arthritis is prevalent in this population.

Recommendation: participate in exercise at the same level as other adults, performing moderate-intensity cardio for a minimum of 150 to 400 minutes each week or vigorous-intensity cardio for 75-150 minutes per week. However, be cautious about chronic diseases such as arthritis. Balance training is recommended. 


# Chr15: Considerations for Clients with Musculoskeletal Issues

## Common Injuries and Reactions to Healing

- Acute and Chronic injuries: the physiology of healing

![IMG_1149](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/49c73174-4c8c-452e-af7e-4c33aaae6000)

Phase I - inflammation (3-4 days after injury): implement RICE (rest or restricted activity, ice, compression, and elevation). Phase II - repair (consists of both repair and regeneration of tissue; may overlap with inflammation and last approx 6 weeks). Phase III - remodeling (overlaps with repair at about 3-6 weeks post-injury; healing, especially of ligament and bone, can last 1-2 years). 

At pain levels above 3 out of 10 the exercise should stop and modified. 

#### Common Acute Injuries

- Muscle strains: tears of the muscle fibers due to work beyond capacity.

- Ligament sprains: more frequently occur as pressure to stretch the ligament. e.g. ACL (anterior cruciate ligament).

![IMG_1150](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/ba7edf45-da56-432f-8ef8-291c7e3fdbfb)

- Cartilage Damage: compression of the joint coupled with a shearing motion > joint stiffness, clicking or popping with weight-bearing activities, joint pain.

- Bone fractures; Head, neck and back injuries

E.G. A client is physically ready to return to exercise after experiencing an ankle injury:

## Common Overuse Conditions

- Tendinitis, bursitis, and fasciitis: inflammation

An inflammation of the wrist extensor, referred to as tennis elbow, is also called lateral epicondylitis.

The median nerve is commonly compressed due to carpal tunnel syndrome, which is the most frequently occurring compression syndrome of the wrist. Repetitive wrist and finger flexion when flexor tendons are strained results in a narrowing of the carpal tunnel.

- Stress fracture: imbalance in bone formation and bone resorption.


## Preventing Musculoskeletal Injury

- Flexibility and elasticity

- Warm-up

- Recovery


## Programming Considerations for Clients with Musculoskeletal Issues

- When pain is present: quantifying the level of pain, acknowledge the client's feelings

- Acute injuries: PT must defer to the return-to-activity protocol provided by the physician.

- Chronic injuries and conditions: Lifestyle and health-history questionnaire covering history, pain, activity, and treatment. Pay attention to warm-up, goal establishment, cool-down, recovery

## Common Conditions of Upper Extremity

- Shoulder: 1. address postural imbalances, 2. strengthen the scapular stabilizing muscles, 3. improve the strength of the anterior shoulder muscles and pectoralis major through controlled pushing motion, 4. begin to introduce overhead activities.

![IMG_1152](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/71e9622c-a726-4a97-8781-1f604b86e0b3)

![IMG_1153](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/e4454925-2206-4d0b-9658-e4731d2ec8b1)


- Elbow, wrist, and hand: 1. Limit  overuse by introducing various grips for comfort and/or wearing gloves to increase friction, 2. Increase ROM through gentle stretches in all planes of motion, 3. Improve strength of wrist and hand, 4. Remove grips or gloves and slowly introduce volume to pulling exercises. 

## Common Conditions of the Spine

- Neck: 1. Observe the relationship of neck position to that of the thoracic spine and shoulder (forward-rounded shoulders and exaggerated kyphosis will be especially common), 2. introduce gentle movement and stretching, 3. Refer to a physician if the pain is severe or persistent.

- Low back (a common postural dysfunction associated is exaggerated lordosis - tight erector spinae in the lumbar region and potential weakness in the posterior chain):

## Common Conditions of the Lower Extremity

![IMG_1154](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/af596aa9-8a7a-41eb-8a25-7e297dfd6888)


- Hip: 1. address any imbalance between the right and left sides, 2. Improve ROM in hip internal and external rotation and single-leg stance stability, 3. Improve hip-hinge mobility and stability, 4. Improve the strength of the muscles of the posterior chain.

Piriformis syndrome causes compression of the sciatic nerve. Evaluate the pelvic position - the height of the iliac crests. Program design should focus on balancing the position via static stretching and conditioning of the taut muscle.

Hip arthritis and hip replacement


- Knee: Pay close attention to the hip, ankle, and foot (pronation or supination). 1. address any imbalance between right and left sides, 2. address any tightness and instability in the hip, ankle, and foot that may be contributing to femoral internal rotation, and 3. improve hip-hinge mobility and stability. 4. Improve the strength of the muscles of the posterior chain. U

Iliotibial (IT) band friction syndrome: Observe positional imbalance of the pelvis. Tightness in the IT band causes an excessive lateral force to the patella via its fascial connection, and is associated with patellofemoral pain syndrome. 

Tendinitis

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS)


- Ankle and Lower leg: 1. address mobility and stability in the foot and ankle, 2. improve strength in the muscles that control movement in the sagittal plane and then transverse plane, 4. improve strength in the posterior chain

Shin splints (medial tibial stress syndrome MTSS and anterior shin splints)

Ankle sprains: follow return-to-activity guidelines. lateral movement creates an opening of the lateral ankle.

Achilles tendonitis

Plantar fasciitis: most important to include stretching exercising for the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantar fascia

Stretching soleus and gastrocnemius helps relieve medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS)
