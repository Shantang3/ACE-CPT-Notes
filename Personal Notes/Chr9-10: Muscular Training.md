# Chr9: Muscular Training -  Foundations and Benefit

## Anatomical systems

- Skeletal system: 206 bones (compact or cortical bone - dense outer 75%, spongy or trabecular bone - inner structure).

![IMG_1049](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/1f3fee88-b08a-400b-bb4e-edf7a03d44cf)

Axial skeleton (74) - central nervous system,  Appendicular skeleton (remaining 126), articulations - synovial joint (The most common type of joint, freely movable; 4 angular movements include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction)

The planes of motion: sagittal - divides the body into right and left halves; transverse - divides the body into superior and inferior halves; frontal - divides the body into anterior and posterior halves.

- Nervous system: central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS, somatic and autonomic).

The parasympathetic nervous system aids in controlling normal functions when the body is relaxed and aids in digesting food, storing energy, and promoting growth. The sympathetic nervous system is activated when there's a stressor or emergency (severe pain, anger, etc.) to stop storing energy and mobilize all resources to respond. 

- Muscular System: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle.

Muscle function and muscle-fiber arrangement: longitudinal, unipennate, bipennate, multipennate. 

Ddecomposite: muscle >> bundles of muscle fibers surrounded by perimysium >> muscle fiber, endomysium - connective tissue surrounding individual muscle fibers)

Slow-twitch muscle fiber: type 1, contains a relatively large amount of mitochondria and higher concentrations of myoglobin >> resistant to fatigue and capable of sustaining aerobic metabolism.

Fast-twitch muscle fiber (type 2): TypeIIx or fast-glycolytic fibers >> contain a relatively small amount of mitochondria and limited aerobic metabolism; however possess a high number of glycolytic enzymes; TypeIIa or intermediate/fast oxidative glycolytic fibers >> speed, fatigue resistance, and force-production capabilities, for strength and power activities.


## Connective Tissue

"Cellular glue" that made up of dozens of proteins, including collagen. Collagen's physical properties are mainly tensile strength and inextensibility. Elastic fibers are made up of amino acids and are mainly responsible for determining the range of extensibility of muscle cells. 


## Human Motion Terminology

Synergist muscles assist the agonist in causing a desired action. Co-contraction happens when the agonist and antagonist contract together to foster joint stability

- Muscular action: static (isometric) action - balance and stabilization training; concentric (shortening) action; eccentric (lengthening action).

- Kinetic chain movement: closed-kinetic-chain exercises >> end of the chain is fixed such as squat, emphasize compression of joints; Open-kinetic-chain exercises >> end of the chain is free such as seated leg extension, involve more shearing forces at the joint.

- Mobility and stability: mobility - ankle, hip, thoracic spine, glenohumeral; stability - foot, knee, lumber pine, scapulothoracic.

- Balance and alignment: Center of gravity (COG), line of gravity, and base of support (BOS). 

  

## Benefit of Muscular Training

Increased physical capacity, enhanced metabolic function, reduced injury risk, and disease prevention.

Wolff's Law: changes in bone structure coincide with changes in bone function. That is, when the skeleton is subject to stressful forces, such as exercise, it responds by laying down more bone tissue, thereby increasing its density. 


## Physiological Adaptation to Muscular Training: Acute and Long-term

Two principal long-term physiological adaptations: increasing muscular strength (motor learning) and muscle size (hypertrophy; such as myofibrillar hypertrophy - increase in the number of myofibrils or contractile proteins).

Factors that influence muscular strength and hypertrophy: hormone levels, sex, age, muscle fiber type (slow-switch fibers activated at lower force levels and fast-switch fibers activated at higher force levels, while typeII experience greater size increase), muscle length, limb length, tendon insertion point.


## Muscular Training Principles

Be aware of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS): exceptionally challenging training sessions are typically associated with several days of muscle fatigue and weakness, they may not lead to larger and stronger muscles. 

- progression: 1st and simplest method is to increase the number of repetitions with a given resistance (progressive repetitions -  increasing workload). A double-progression training protocol is suggested. eg. repeat time 12 increase to 15, then increase weight/workload %5 for 12 repeats, then 15 then 5% increase...

- Specificity: for achieving desired muscular-training objectives. Be aware to train all the major muscle groups and balance the training; use appropriate resistance-repetition protocols. 

- Overload: gradually adding more exercise resistance than the muscles have previously encountered. 

- Reversibility: reinforce the importance of muscular training as a lifestyle component. 

- Diminishing returns, esp strength plateau: to change the training exercise.


## Muscular Training Variables and Program Design

- Needs assessment: goal activity or sport - movement, physiological, injury analysis; individual assessment - current conditioning level, training history and technique, history of injury/fear, tolerance for discomfort.

- Training frequency: inversely related to training volume and intensity

- Exercise selection and order: primary exercises involve multiple muscles from one or larger muscle areas; accessory exercises involve smaller muscle groups from more isolated areas that span one joint. Recommendation: target each major muscle group two or three days per week, allowing a minimum of 48 hours of recovery between sessions. 

- Training volume and loads: sets, repetitions, and intensity.

Volumn = sets * reps * weight load (for load-volume calculation). Typically lower for competitive powerlifters as they focus on improving muscle's ability to max recruit fibers to generate higher amounts of force; competitive bodybuilders. on the other hand, perform higher-volume workouts.  

![IMG_1071](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/a1b904ee-1697-41a1-bb3f-bcfc75821615)

- Training intensity: % of max resistance (higher intensity training sessions require lower exercise volume). Most periodization models for muscular training begin with high-volume/low-intensity workouts, progress to moderate-volume/moderate-intensity workouts and conclude with lower-volume/higher-intensity workouts. 

- Training Tempo: commonly recommended movement speed of six seconds per repetition. 

- Best intervals (recovery period): replenishment of muscle energy substrates is relatively rapid, with 50% renewal within the first 30 sec, 75% within the first minute, and 95% renewal within the first two minutes.

#### E.G.

1. developing general muscular fitness: sets 1-4, repetitions 8-15, rest interval: 2-3min, intensity: 20-70% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

2. improving muscular endurance: sets 2-3, repetitions >=12, rest interval: 2-3min, intensity: <67% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

3. experiencing muscular hypertrophy: sets 3-6, repetitions 6-12, rest interval: 30-9-sec, intensity: 67-85% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

4. developing greater muscular strength: sets 2-6, repetitions <=6, rest interval: 2-5min, intensity: >85% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

5. a powerlifter who performs single-effort events: sets 3-5, repetitions 1-2, rest interval: 2-5min, intensity: 80-90% of 1RM (one-repetition max)



## Components of a Muscular-Training Session.

- Warm-up: 5-10 minutes, lightweight, take into account all planes of motion. Focus on the movement patterns planned for the rest of the workout.

- Conditioning: frequency, duration, intensity, and modality. 

- Cool-down: stress reduction, return heart rate to resting levels, and initiate relation and the recovery process.



# Chr 10: Muscular training: assessments

Postural stability, joint mobility, functional movement, balance, cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscular fitness. 

## Functional Assessments

Improve joint function through muscular endurance, flexibility, core function, static balance, and dynamic balance.

- Static postural assessment: muscle imbalance, altered neural action. 

Correctible factors: repetitive movements (muscular pattern overload), awkward positions and movement (habitual), side dominance, lack of joint stability/mobility, and imbalanced strength-training programs. VS. non-correctible factors: congenital conditions (eg. scoliosis), pathologies (eg. rheumatoid arthritis), structural deviation, a certain type of trauma. 

Assessing posture, start by observing a client's stance following the right-angle rule of the body. The objective is to observe the symmetry against the right angles that weight-bearing joints make relative to the line of gravity; focus on the obvious/gross imbalance and avoid getting caught up in minor postural asymmetries. Observe from frontal views(anterior - bisects right and left sides equally, posterior view - line of gravity bisects the sacrum and overlaps the spinous processes of vertebrae), sagittal view, and transverse view.

Common postural deviations: subtalar pronations/supination and the effect on tibial and femoral rotation; hip adduction; pelvic tilting; shoulder position and the thoracic spine; head position

Fig 10-18: postural assessment checklist

- Static Balance: unipedal stance test or timed one-leg stance test >> risk for falls, abilities to perform activities of daily living, and risk of low-back pain. 

- Dynamic balance: Y balance test - anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral; 6 ft * 6 ft >> injury risk, not recommended for older adults.

- McGrill's torso muscular endurance test battery: trunk flexor endurance test, trunk lateral endurance test, trunk extensor endurance test >> total test battery interpretation: flexion: extension ratio should be less than 1.0; right-side bridge:left-side bridge should be no greater than 0.05 from a balanced score of 1.0; side bridge: extension ratio should be less than 0.75.

- Flexibility Assessments

Fig 10-33 through 35: normal range of motion (NRM)

Thomas test for hip flexor length: knee flex to 80 degrees and flatness of back and sacrum.

Passive straight-leg raise: >= 80 degrees of movement before the pelvis rotates posteriorly as normal hamstring length. 

Shoulder flexion and extension: Flex the shoulder to 170-180 degrees or hands (nearly) touching the floor and extend the shoulders to 50-60 degrees off the floor.



## Movement Assessments

Perform five primary movements effectively in all three planes of motion without compromising postural or joint stability. 

- Bend-and-left assessment: squat pattern (table 10-16)

- Single-leg assessment: step-up

- Push assessment: shoulder push stabilization

- Pull assessment: standing row

- Rotation assessment: thoracic spine mobility

- Muscular-endurance assessments: push-ups (full elbow extension with a straight back and rigid torso, chest touching the personal trainer's fist or a rolled towel without resting), body-weight squats.
  
- Muscular-strength assessments: 1-RM bench-press assessment, 1-RM squat assessment. 

Relative strength =  absolute strength/body weight, where absolute strenth = amount of weight lifted on time >> one-repitition max (1-RM)

Note: Consideration of spotting

- Submaximal strength assessments: evaluate upper- and lower-strength

## Power assessment; Load/speed, or Speed/agility/quickness Assessments

Power = force * vekicuty = work/time, where force = mass*acceleration, velocity = distance/time, work=force*distance.

- Vertical jump assessment

- T-test
