# Chr11: Intergrated Exercise Programming: from Evidence to Practice

## Evidence-based Practice (EBP)

Formulate (a question) > search (for health and fitness research evidence) > scrutinize (the quality of research evidence)

## ACE IFT Model Cardio Training Program 

## ACE IFT Muscular Traning program

? repeated 

- Funtional training covers some core stablillization, Flexibility exercise

- Load/Speed Training covers some plyometrics for the lower and uper body

Movement pattern: linear forward > lateral > backpadel > rotational > crossover cutting curving

Lower body: jump in place, jumping jacks, alternating push-ff, single linear jump, standing long/vertical jump, multiple linear jumps,
front/lateral cone jump, multidirecctional jump, hexagon drill, diagonal cone jump ...

Upper body: power push-ups, medicine ball power push ups, horizontal chest pass, supine vertical chest toss...

Speed drills: arm squeeze and rear/forward arm drive, ABC (high knee, high marches, butt kicks) drills ...

agility-ladder/hurdke drills: forward/lateral jumps/hops, backpedal, multidirectional; katerak shuffles, pro agility drill ...



## Periodization

interntionally varies the training stimuli, especially with respect to intensity and volumn (resistance, repitition, and sets).
Divided into time segments and macrocycles (6-12 months as program timeframe), mesocycle (as specific training goals) and 
microcycles (as progressive training segment for each mesocycle).
Performed in either linear manner (consistent protocol) or undulating approach (different training protocol).



## Program Maitainance 

Srategy #1: minimum dose of activity to maitain weight and cardio health quates to 1-mile per day.

Strategy #2: low dose HIIT (12min/weel) improve cardio health.

Strategy #3: intergrate a single long training session into the biweekly training routine.

Strategy #4: combined cardio and muscular training is an antidote to detraining. 


## Recovery

Frequency, intensity, time/duration, type between bouts (active or passitive).

Applications: program active recovery (supeior to passive recovery); program specific recovery intensities, program giit
