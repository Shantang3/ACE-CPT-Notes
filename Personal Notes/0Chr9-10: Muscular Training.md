# Chr9: Muscular Training -  Foundations and Benefit

## Anatomical systems

- Skeletal system: 206 bones (compact or cortical bone - dense outer 75%, spongy or trabecular bone - inner structure).

![IMG_1049](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/1f3fee88-b08a-400b-bb4e-edf7a03d44cf)

Axial skeleton (74) - central nervous system (sacrum of the spine consists of 5 fused vertebrae),  Appendicular skeleton (remaining 126), articulations - synovial joint (The most common type of joint, freely movable; 4 angular movements include flexion, extension, abduction, adduction). 

- The planes of motion: sagittal - divides the body into right and left halves; transverse - divides the body into superior and inferior halves; frontal - divides the body into anterior and posterior halves. Flexion occurs in the sagittal plane of motion.

Sagittal: plantar flexion/dorsiflexion, extension/flexion, eversion, 

Frontal: adduction/abduction(away from body), inversion, elevation, depression, 

Transverse: Supination, horizontal extension/flexion, pronation, rotation

Multiplanar: opposition, circumduction

- Nervous system: central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS, somatic and autonomic).

The parasympathetic nervous system aids in controlling normal functions when the body is relaxed and aids in digesting food, storing energy, and promoting growth. The sympathetic nervous system is activated when there's a stressor or emergency (severe pain, anger, etc.) to stop storing energy and mobilize all resources to respond. 

- Muscular System: skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle.

![IMG_1058](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/d3eabba2-1c88-4744-ada4-bff94891a615)

! Table 9.4 to 9.11: Major muscles at the ankle, foot, knee, hip, spine, shoulder girdle, shoulder, elbow, radioulnar joints, wrist. 

Muscle function and muscle-fiber arrangement: longitudinal, unipennate, bipennate, multipennate. One propertythat all muscle tissue has in common is to contract and develop tension. 

Ddecomposite: muscle >> bundles of muscle fibers surrounded by perimysium >> muscle fiber, endomysium - connective tissue surrounding individual muscle fibers)

![IMG_1065 copy](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/627fbe0b-640b-4419-8c7e-7915d4231129)

Slow-twitch muscle fiber: type 1, contains a relatively large amount of mitochondria and higher concentrations of myoglobin >> resistant to fatigue and capable of sustaining aerobic metabolism. The contracts more slowly and create lower force outputs.

Fast-twitch muscle fiber (type 2): TypeIIx or fast-glycolytic fibers >> contain a relatively small amount of mitochondria and limited aerobic metabolism; however possess a high number of glycolytic enzymes; TypeIIa or intermediate/fast oxidative glycolytic fibers >> speed, fatigue resistance, and force-production capabilities, for strength and power activities.



## Connective Tissue

"Cellular glue" that made up of dozens of proteins, including collagen. Collagen's physical properties are mainly tensile strength and inextensibility. Elastic fibers are made up of amino acids and are mainly responsible for determining the range of extensibility of muscle cells. 


## Human Motion Terminology

Synergist muscles assist the agonist in causing a desired action. Co-contraction happens when the agonist and antagonist contract together to foster joint stability.

A muscle that creates a major movement is called a prime mover, or agonist; the muscle on the opposite is called an opposing muscle, or antagonist. 

#### Type of muscular action 
- Static (isometric) action - balance and stabilization training. E.g. holding the torso upright during V-sit; a brief hold at the top of push-up, and quadriceps in a wall sit. 

- Concentric (shortening) action - isotonic muscle contraction in which the muscle develops tension and shortens when stimulated; E.g. biceps brachii in the lift phase of a bicep curl. 

- Eccentric (lengthening action) - isotonic muscle contraction in which the muscle lengthens against a resistance. E.g. biceps brachii in the lowering phase of a bicep curl.

In the training, 6 seconds per rep is recommended with 2-3 sec concentric phase and 3-4 sec eccentric phase. 

#### Kinetic chain movement: 

- Closed-kinetic-chain exercises >> end of the chain is fixed such as squat, emphasize compression of joints;

- Open-kinetic-chain exercises >> end of the chain is free such as seated leg extension, involve more shearing forces at the joint.

#### Mobility and stability: 

- Mobility: range of uninhibited movement around a joint - ankle, hip, thoracic spine, glenohumeral.

- Stability: the ability to maintain or control movement or position (synergistic actions of the joints and neuromuscular system) -  foot, knee, lumber pine, scapulothoracic.

The shoulder joint is considered the most mobile.

Other: Balance and alignment: Center of gravity (COG), line of gravity, and base of support (BOS). 

  

## Benefit of Muscular Training

Increased physical capacity, enhanced metabolic function, reduced injury risk, and disease prevention.

Wolff's Law: changes in bone structure coincide with changes in bone function. That is, when the skeleton is subject to stressful forces, such as exercise, it responds by laying down more bone tissue, thereby increasing its density. 


## Physiological Adaptation to Muscular Training: Acute and Long-term

Two principal long-term physiological adaptations: increasing muscular strength (motor learning) and muscle size (hypertrophy; such as myofibrillar hypertrophy - increase in the number of myofibrils or contractile proteins).

Factors that influence muscular strength and hypertrophy: hormone levels, sex, age, muscle fiber type (slow-switch fibers activated at lower force levels and fast-switch fibers activated at higher force levels, while typeII experience greater size increase), muscle length, limb length, tendon insertion point.


## Muscular Training Principles

Most will be anaerobic (without the presence of oxygen). For muscular hypertrophy goals, a rest interval of 2-5 minutes is recommended for full recovery of ATP. 

Be aware of delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS): exceptionally challenging training sessions are typically associated with several days of muscle fatigue and weakness, they may not lead to larger and stronger muscles. 

- progression: 1st and simplest method is to increase the number of repetitions with a given resistance (progressive repetitions -  increasing workload). A double-progression training protocol is suggested. eg. repeat time 12 increase to 15, then increase weight/workload %5 for 12 repeats, then 15 then 5% increase...

- Specificity: for achieving desired muscular-training objectives. Be aware to train all the major muscle groups and balance the training; use appropriate resistance-repetition protocols. 

- Overload: gradually adding more exercise resistance than the muscles have previously encountered. 

- Reversibility: reinforce the importance of muscular training as a lifestyle component. 

- Diminishing returns, esp strength plateau: to change the training exercise.


## Muscular Training Variables and Program Design

- Needs assessment: goal activity or sport - movement, physiological, injury analysis; individual assessment - current conditioning level, training history and technique, history of injury/fear, tolerance for discomfort.

- Training frequency: inversely related to training volume and intensity

- Exercise selection and order: primary exercises involve multiple muscles from one or larger muscle areas; accessory exercises involve smaller muscle groups from more isolated areas that span one joint. Recommendation: target each major muscle group two or three days per week, allowing a minimum of 48 hours of recovery between sessions. 

- Training volume and loads: sets, repetitions, and intensity.

Volumn = sets * reps * weight load (for load-volume calculation). Typically lower for competitive powerlifters as they focus on improving muscle's ability to max recruit fibers to generate higher amounts of force; competitive bodybuilders. on the other hand, perform higher-volume workouts.  

![IMG_1071](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/a1b904ee-1697-41a1-bb3f-bcfc75821615)

- Training intensity: % of max resistance (higher intensity training sessions require lower exercise volume). Most periodization models for muscular training begin with high-volume/low-intensity workouts, progress to moderate-volume/moderate-intensity workouts and conclude with lower-volume/higher-intensity workouts. 

- Training Tempo: commonly recommended movement speed of six seconds per repetition. 

- Best intervals (recovery period): replenishment of muscle energy substrates is relatively rapid, with 50% renewal within the first 30 sec, 75% within the first minute, and 95% renewal within the first two minutes.

#### E.G.

1. developing general muscular fitness: sets 1-4, repetitions 8-15, rest interval: 2-3min, intensity: 20-70% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

2. improving muscular endurance: sets 2-3, repetitions >=12, rest interval: 2-3min, intensity: <67% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

3. experiencing muscular hypertrophy: sets 3-6, repetitions 6-12, rest interval: 30-9-sec, intensity: 67-85% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

4. developing greater muscular strength: sets 2-6, repetitions <=6, rest interval: 2-5min, intensity: >85% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

5. a powerlifter who performs single-effort events: sets 3-5, repetitions 1-2, rest interval: 2-5min, intensity: 80-90% of 1RM (one-repetition max)

6. A client who wants to lose weight, but a bit apprehensive about muscular training of "getting big": explain the average adults' muscle-tissue loss of 5 lb per decade, and how resistance training can help her restore lost muscle and raise resting metabolism.  



## Components of a Muscular-Training Session.

- Warm-up (active proprioceptors, improve balance and coordination, increase blood flow, enhance the elasticity of connective tissues): 5-10 minutes, lightweight, take into account all planes of motion. Focus on the movement patterns planned for the rest of the workout.

- Conditioning: client goals, frequency, duration, intensity, rest intervals, and modality. 

- Cool-down: stress reduction, return heart rate to resting levels, and initiate relation and the recovery process.



# Chr 10: Muscular training: assessments

Postural stability, joint mobility, functional movement, balance, cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscular fitness. 

## Functional Assessments

To help the PT to observe a client's efficacies in postural stabilization, balance, and core function. 
Improve joint function through muscular endurance, flexibility, core function, static balance, and dynamic balance.

#### Static postural assessment: muscle imbalance, altered neural action. 

The right-angle rule of the body: how the body represents itself in vertical alignment across the major joints: ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, and spine. To observe in three planes, noting specific "static" asymmetries at the joints.

![IMG_1072](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/765c17ee-d7f4-4f96-80ac-5d1e1432393e)

Note the following summary is listed in the form of facilitated/hypertonic/shortened + inhibited/lengthened. 
- Lordosis Posture: facilitated hip flexor & lumbar extensors, inhibited hip extensors & external obliques & rectus abdominis.

- Kyphosis Posture: facilitated anterior chest/shoulders & latissimus dorsi & neck extensors, inhibited upper-back extensors & scapular stablizers & neck flexors.

- Flat-back Posture: facilitated rectus abdominis & upper-back extensors & neck extensors & ankle plantar flexors, inhibited lliacus/psoas major & internal obliques & lumbar extensors & neck flexors.

- Sway-back Posture: facilitated hamstrings & upper fibers of posterior obliques & lumbar extersors & neck extensors , inhibited lliacus/psoas major & external obliques & upper-back extensors & neck flexors.


Correctible factors: repetitive movements (muscular pattern overload), awkward positions and movement (habitual), side dominance, lack of joint stability/mobility, and imbalanced strength-training programs. VS. non-correctible factors: congenital conditions (eg. scoliosis), pathologies (eg. rheumatoid arthritis), structural deviation, a certain type of trauma. 

Assessing posture, start by observing a client's stance following the right-angle rule of the body. The objective is to observe the symmetry against the right angles that weight-bearing joints make relative to the line of gravity; focus on the obvious/gross imbalance and avoid getting caught up in minor postural asymmetries. Observe from frontal views(anterior - bisects right and left sides equally, posterior view - line of gravity bisects the sacrum and overlaps the spinous processes of vertebrae), sagittal view, and transverse view.

#### Common postural deviations: 

- Subtalar pronations/supination and the effect on tibial and femoral rotation: With shoes off, place the hands firmly on the fronts of the tighs; note the orientation of knees and thighs when moving between pronation and supination, and the calcaneus everts as the subtalar joint is pronated.

- Hip adduction (hip hiking): in standing and in gait, a lateral tilt of the pelvis elevates one hip higher than the other, leading to the limb-length discrepancy. Note that sleeping on one's side produces a similar effect.

![Screenshot 2023-10-06 at 11 24 11 AM](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/8f4f7bed-975c-4385-b55b-5e7e22f2f0cf)

- Pelvic tilting: Anterior tilting of the pelvis frequently occurs in individuals with tight hip flexors, which is generally associated with a physically inactive and sedentary lifestyle. Anterior pelvic tilt will increase lordosis in the lumbar spine.

![IMG_1076](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/22546654-c565-4f38-ab39-88fc030b49b8)

- Shoulder position and the thoracic spine: to look from a posterior view, the vertebral and/or inferior angle of the scapulae protrude outward (scapular protraction), or the inferior angle and vertebral border outward (winged scapulae)> inability of the scapular stabilizers.

![IMG_1080](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/d021b1c9-9352-4cca-a3c1-75eca0853cf7)

- head position

![IMG_1082](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/73100acf-a09f-4947-8248-30de4000e02d)


#### Static Balance: unipedal stance test or timed one-leg stance test 

Info of risk for falls, abilities to perform activities of daily living, and risk of low-back pain. 

#### Dynamic balance: Y balance test 

Reach for three directions anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral; 6 ft * 6 ft >> injury risk, not recommended for older adults.

## McGrill's torso muscular endurance test battery: 

- Trunk flexor endurance test: rectus abdominis, external and internal obliques, and transverse abdominis; somatic contraction of anterior muscles. Not suitable for low-back pain, recent back surgery, acute low-back flare-up. 
  
- Trunk lateral endurance test, or side-bridge test: lateral core muscles - transverse abdominis, oblique, quadratus lumborum, and erector spinae. 

- Trunk extensor endurance test: torso extensor muscles - erector spinae and multifidi.

- Total test battery interpretation: flexion: extension ratio should be less than 1.0; right-side bridge:left-side bridge should be no greater than 0.05 from a balanced score of 1.0; side bridge: extension ratio should be less than 0.75.

#### Flexibility Assessments - normal range of motion (NRM)

Joint capsule has the most influence over flexibility

![IMG_1085](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/181fae1d-236f-4076-9ece-7756056968bf)

- Thomas test for hip flexor length: knee flex to 80 degrees and flatness of back and sacrum.

![IMG_1087](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/1c1a0bfd-b3b5-4fa1-a424-87fde1f7ffc2)

- Passive straight-leg raise: >= 80 degrees of movement before the pelvis rotates posteriorly as normal hamstring length.

![IMG_1089](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/3aebd044-8407-4fcf-ba0e-3433265e5617)

- Shoulder flexion and extension: Flex the shoulder to 170-180 degrees or hands (nearly) touching the floor and extend the shoulders to 50-60 degrees off the floor.

![IMG_1091(1)](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/230d9ed2-d17b-47d3-8256-3e5779a9c081)

## Movement Assessments

Perform five primary movements effectively in all three planes of motion without compromising postural or joint stability. 

#### Bend-and-left assessment: squat pattern 

- Lumbar dominance: a lack of core and gluteal strength; chronic hip flexor, such as who sit for prolonged periods.
  
- Quadriceps dominance: more pressure into the knees, placing greater loads on ACL.
  
- Glute dominance: preferred method of squatting, also helps activate hamstrings.

The biggest issue people face is not enough ankle dorsiflexion. 

![IMG_1092](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/c6dc48a7-f150-4ac8-9eff-48824af50958)

![IMG_1093](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/00125890-4776-4405-9015-bbdf9fe96a12)

#### Single-leg assessment: step-up

![IMG_1094](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/30aca2a4-39e3-4f7b-b2a8-1dc5ed130acb)

![IMG_1095](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/da3247c7-0559-4c98-b4cf-89602c0a0a01)

#### Push assessment: shoulder push stabilization

![IMG_1096](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/eff189c4-491d-4573-b13d-a0e9e62b2aae)

#### Pull assessment: standing row

![IMG_1097](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/2c49f848-986c-4f15-bc56-9243b51f907d)


#### Rotation assessment: thoracic spine mobility

![IMG_1098](https://github.com/Shantang3/ACE-CPT-Notes/assets/25567822/37095b68-bbd7-4cfd-a87d-a188fe4af100)

Note that the lumbar spine generally exhibits limited rotation of around 15 degrees with the balance of trunk rotation. 



## Load/Speed Assessments

- Muscular-endurance assessments: push-ups (full elbow extension with a straight back and rigid torso, chest touching the personal trainer's fist or a rolled towel without resting), body-weight squats.
  
- Muscular-strength assessments: 1-RM bench-press assessment, 1-RM squat assessment, Submaximal strength assessments

Relative strength =  absolute strength/body weight, where absolute strength = amount of weight lifted on time, or one-repetition max (1-RM)

Note: Consideration of spotting - as close as possible for dumbell exercises. 

Left-to-right muscle balance or appropriate ratios of agonist to antagonist muscle strength.



## Power assessment; Speed/agility/quickness Assessments

Power = force * vekicuty = work/time, where force = mass*acceleration, velocity = distance/time, work=force*distance.

- Vertical jump assessment

- T-test
