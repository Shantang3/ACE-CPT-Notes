# Chr12: Considerations for Clients with Obesity

## Possible causes of obesity

Environmental factors, stress, genetics, hormones (leptin, adiponectin, immune hormones, appetite-regulating hormones), sleep, energy balance.


## Nutritional Guidelines

Reduce fat and/or carbohydrate intake to obtain a caloric deficit of 500 - 1000 kcal per day to produce a weight loss of 1/2 lbs per week (based on ~3,500 kcal equals 1 lb of fat). Other recommendations include portion control (serving size and calories in various foods), eating frequency (eating throughout the day), and consuming foods high in nutrient density (nutrient per calorie, considering vitamins minerals, and phytochemicals) and low in energy density (calories per weight or volume, typically high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and low in fat, sweetened beverages and alcohol >> whole food, plant-based diet). 

The current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 46-56 g/day or 10-35% of total caloric intake.

Resting energy expenditure (REE, 60-75% TEE, Total energy expenditure): male (10 * weight in kg) + (6.35 * height in cm) - (5 * age) + 5; female male (10 * weight in kg) + (6.35 * height in cm) - (5 * age) - 161. 



## Exercise Guidelines

Given that the total EE is more important, emphasis should be placed on the total distance or time walked or run (e.g. 10 minutes walking * 3). Be aware that clients with obesity will likely experience challenges when in the heat >> swimming and water exercise with less stress on the joints. Some exercise may not be a good choice due to mobility and/or balance problems. Help the client to release the non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) -  the importance of daily activities such as fidgeting, walking, and standing >> Lifestyle change.  

- Cardio training:

Frequency: as active as possible and work up to at least five days per week. Moderate-intensity cardio at at least three days per week for bouts 20 minutes will begin in the Base Training phase. Lifestyle activities should be done often throughout each day.

Intensity: to moderate intensity. Using talk test, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale of "somewhat hard" / 3-4 out of 10

Time: 30-60 minutes per day, can be done in one session or multiple shorter bouts. 

Type: low-impact, rhythmic exercises using large muscle groups.

Initial Programming Considerations: health benefits. gradually increase the frequency, duration, and/or intensity over a long period. Be careful about the risk of injury especially in the first few months.

Biomechanical consideration for cardio exercise: The preferred type would be a combination of weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing (swim) models. Be performing longer on/or more frequent bouts. Monitor muscle soreness and any orthopedic problem or discomfort. Wear high-quality fitness shoes with good shock-absorbing qualities to minimize joint problems.

Suggested reduction after 13 weeks in clients with overweight: 4 (0.5-13.5) lbs in weight, 1 (0.25-2.35) inches in waist circumference, 3.5 (2-8)% in body fat.

- Muscular training

Frequency: 2-3 days per week with a day of rest between sessions. Intensity: moderate level, 60-70% 1-RM. Time: depends, full-body muscular training should require 20-30 minutes. Type: all major muscle groups using ree weight and/or machine.



## Exercise and Weight Management

In the absence of concurrent caloric restriction, cardio exercise in the range of 150 minutes per week has been associated with moderate weight loss (4.4-6.6 lbs), while 250-420 minutes results in an 11-16.5 lbs loss. The combination of exercise and a sense of eating plan produces the best long-term weight-loss and weight-maintenance results. 

In addition to increased EE and a modified diet with reduced EI, "a comprehensive weight management program should take maximum use of multiple strategies for cognitive behavioral therapy" - calorie reduction, physical activity, and behavioral changes. Consider maintaining a food diary, or refer to community programs. 


## Other weight-loss approaches

- Pharmacological interventions. currently approved drugs in the U.S. include phentermine for short-term use (<3 months), and five obesity pharmacotherapies (orlistat, lorcaserin, phentemine-topiranate, naltrexone-bupropion, and liraglutide 3mg) that can be used longer. Note that regaining weight is common.

- Bariatric surgery. Even if it's more effective, it is associated with greater risks.
