# Chr3: Basics of Behavior Change

## Behavioral Theory Model

### Health Belief Model

People's ideas and underlying emotions about illness, prevention, and treatments may influence health behaviors and decisions about changing (or not charging) health behaviors.

- The belief in the health threat: perceived susceptibility to an illness (the likelihood), perceived seriousness (perception from health screen etc.).

- The perceptions of the health behavior: benefits and barriers. 


### Self-determination Theory

Two basic types of motivation: autonomous motivation ("I want", intrinsic motivation as the highest level); controlled motivation ("I need" by pressure from external forces). 
Include autonomy, competence, and relatedness to create an environment that support intrinsic motivation

The importance of motivational climate in the exercise setting: task-involving (eg. by emphasizing process goals) is better than egO-involving (eg. by emphasizing outcome goals) climates. 

Don't forget social-support strategies.


### Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM)

Refers to the individual's readiness for change, also called as states-of-change model:

1. Stages of changes: per contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance.

2. Processes of changes:

ABC approach: Ask powerful open-ended questions; Break down barriers; Collaborate.

3. Self-efficacy: 

4. Decisional Balance: evaluation of pros and cons of adopting and/or maintaining an activity program. 


## Principles of Behavior Change

### Operant condition

The process by which behaviors are influenced by their consequences (antecedents and consequences). The behavior chains and positive reinforcement.

### Cognitions and Behavior

Replacing irrational thoughts, including jumping to conclusions, all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralizing, labeling, personalization and blame, magnification, and minimization. 

Goal setting and self-monitoring: SMART goal guidelines (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound). 



## Physical Activity and Adherence

Three categories of potential determinants for physical activity:

1. Personal attributes: demographic variables, health status, physical-activity history, psychological traits, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs.

2. Environmental factors: access to facilities, time, and social support.

3. Physical-activity factors: intensity, injury, 



# Chr4: Effective Communication, Goal Setting, and Teaching Techniques

This chapter mainly discussed the four stages of the client-personal trainer relationship

## Rapport Stage

Built upon empathy and rapport, the personal trainer sets the scene for establishing mutual understanding and trust by considering:

- Cultural competence: age, gender, race, ethnicity, educational background, fitness level; beliefs, attitudes, values, and lifestyles ...

- First impression: to provide clients with a sense of caring, respect, clear communication, and professionalism.

- Verbal and non-verbal communication: voice quality, eye contact, facial expression, hand gestures, body position.

- Professional boundaries

- Dealing with difficult clients


## Investigation Stage.

Rapport continues to build during this stage, with more personal information, like medical concerns, fitness-assessment results, body weight, and exercise history.

- Gathing information: lifestyle and health history questionnaire.

- Active listening

- Motivational interviewing: use skills such as sustain talk, ABC approach, OARS (affirmation, reflective, listening and summarizing), righting reflex...
The spirit of motivational interviewing is composed of collaboration, acceptance, compassion, and evocation.

- Respond to difficult disclosure; follow referral procedures if necessary. 


## Planning Stage

The relationship should be viewed as a give-and-take opportunity in terms of communication:

- Setting goals: avoid too many goals or negative goals; set short- and long-term goals as well as performance goals; include clients in the process; revisit goals on a regular basis.

SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.

- Generating ideas and discussing options.

- Formulating a plan

- Evaluating the exercise program.


## Action Stages

The program is a combination of exercises completed by clients on their own and exercises performed with the personal trainer instructing and supervising.

- Self-monitoring approaches

- Effective teaching techniques: pay attention to stages of learning (associative vs. autonomous), learning styles, "tell, show, do", providing feedback, modeling
