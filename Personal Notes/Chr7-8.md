# Chr7: Resting Assessments and Anthropometric Measurements

## Sequencing Assessment

- Resting vital signs: hear rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), height and weight.

- Static posture and movement assessment (Chr10). 

- Joint flexibility and muscle length (Chr10).

- Balance and core function (Chr10).

- Cardiorespiratory fitness (Chr8).

- Body composition and anthropometry.

- Muscular fitness (endurance and strength) (Chr10).

- Skill-related parameters (agility, coordination, power, reactivity, and speed) (Chr10).

TODO: add table 7.1



## Cardiovascular Assessment at Rest

- Resting HR (RHR): Sinus bradycardia (slow HR): RHR < 60 bpm; Normal sinus rhythm: RHR 60 – 100 bmp; Sinus tacgycardia: RHR > 100 bpm.

- Blood pressure (BP):systolic BP (SBP): higher number and represents the pressure created by the heart as it pumps blood into circulation via ventricular contraction; diastolic BP (DBP): lower number. 

(SBP and/or DBP in mmHg) Normal: <120 and <80; Elevated: 120-129 and < 80; Stage 1 Hypertension: 130-139 or 80-89; Stage 2 hypertension: >=140 or >=90 



## Anthropometric Measurements and Body Composition

- Lean body mass: muscle, connective tissue, bones, blood, nervous tissue, skin and organs.

- Essential body fat: insulation, thermoregulation, hormone production, cushioning of vital organs, and maintenance of certain body function. Man 2-5%, women 10-13%.

- Subcutaneous fat and visceral fat.

Skinfold Measurement, Anthropometric Measurement.

Expected change and time: in 2-3 months, reduce  body fat 2.7-5.9% or waist circumference 1.9-3.3 cm. 



## Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index

BMI = Weight(kg) / Height(m)^2 or 703* Weight (lb)/Height(in)^2

TODO: BMI table


## Circumference Measurement

TODO: TWO tables

- Waist circumference

- Waist-to-hip ratio


# Chr8: Cardiorespiratory Training: Physiology, Assessments, and Programming

## Anatomical System

- Cardiorespiratory system: The categories of blood vessels: arteries and arterioles (carry blood from heart); capillaries; venules and veins (return blood to heart).

- Respiratory system



## Physiology of Cardiorespiratory System

- Oxygen-carrying capacity: the ability to adequately ventilate the alveoli in the lungs (pulmonary ventilation: rate and depth of breathing – tidal volumn), the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of the blood.

- Oxygen Delivery: 

Cardiac output = HR * SV (stroke volume): at rest average 5 litters/min; during maximal exercise 20-25 and can rise to 30-40 liters/min.

- Oxygen extraction: for aerobic production of ATP in the mitochondria, depends on muscle-fiber type and availability of specialized oxidative enzymes. 



## Physiological Adaptations to Acute and Chronic Cardiorespiratory Exercise

- Muscular system: low-intensity endurance exercise – type 1 (slow-twitch) muscle fibers – size and number of mitochondria – hypertrophy; high-intensity exercise – type 2 (fast-twitch) muscle fibers – number of anaerobic enzymes.

- Cardiovascular system: larger SV, as maximal HR (MHR) not increase with training.

- Time required for increases in cardiorespiratory fitness: Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max, standard marker of cardio) – increase with training but plateaus about 6 months; ventilatory threshold (VT, important marker of metabolism, permits prediction of lactate threshold) – change continue for years, as capillary growth and increased mitochondrial density.
