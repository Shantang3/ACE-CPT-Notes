# Chr1: Role and Scope of Practice for Personal Trainers

**Key: Personal Trainer's scope of practice defines a unique profession dedicated to helping people improve fitness, health, and quality of life through physical activities, and PREVENT disease.**

The primary purpose of professional certifications: to protect the public from harm by assessing if candidates meet established levels of minimum competence. 

## Professional Responsibility and Ethics

- Client privacy: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) - the use and disclosure of an individual's protected health info.

- Referral.

- Some common "outside scope of practice": recommending supplements (unless other credentials such as RD or MD), creating meal plans and menus (refer to a registered dietitian or licensed nutritionist), determining/treating injury (refer to a physician, athletic trainer, or physical therapist) (while assessing exercise limitations is within), extreme emotional upheaval (with empathy but refer to licensed mental health prof), providing massage (refer to the licensed massage therapist).

- It is within the scope of practice for all health and exercise professionals to share dietary advice endorsed or developed by the federal government, including Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the MyPlate recommendation.

# Chr 2: The ACE Integrated Fitness Training Model (IFT)

**Key: ACE IFT Model as a practice to provide clients with evidence-based and personalized exercise programs.**

Function-Health-Fitness-Performance Continuum

The greatest impact of PT is to help clients positively change health-related behaviors and establish positive relationships with exercise.

Mandatory fitness assessment (not confused with health screening, which should be conducted with each client) is not encouraged at the very initial stage, as conducting an initial comprehensive assessment of fitness and body composition can most likely create a barrier to fitness-related behavioral changes for some clients.


## ACE IFT: A client-centered approach

Building rapport is a critical component; ABC approach: ask open-ended questions, Break down barriers, and Collaborate.

- Base Training (different from aerobic-basic training that is performed by endurance athletes in offseason training): develop an initial aerobic base in clients who have been insufficiently active (non-consistently performing moderate-intensity cardio for at least 20 mins on at least 3 days per week). The goal is to create early positive exercise experiences while gradually increasing duration and frequency. No cardio assessments are recommended during this phase; should give positive feedback for completing 5-min exercise bout and remind the beneficence. 
  
- Fitness Training: focus on enhancing the client's aerobic efficiency by progressing the program based on individual goals.
  
- Performance Training: for individuals with goals focused on success in endurance sports and events.
  

## Muscular Training:

- Functional Training: to establish or re-establish postural stability and kinetic chain mobility by improving joint function, muscular endurance, flexibility, core function static balance, and dynamic balance. Use primarily body-weight resistance.
  
- Movement Training: to develop good movement patterns without compromising postural or joint stability. Five primary movements: bend-and-lift movements, single-leg movement, pushing movement, pulling movement, and rotational movement. Emphasize the proper sequencing of movement and control of COG.
  
- Load/speed Training: to create a need for increased force production with external loads to movement; should integrate Functional Training exercise of the five primary movements (e.g. in warm-up or cool-down). The goals include muscular strength, muscular endurance, muscle hypertrophy, and positive changes in body composition (body building).
