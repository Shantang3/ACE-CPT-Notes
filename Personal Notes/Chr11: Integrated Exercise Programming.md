#### Functional training

- Muscular endurance
  
- Flexibility: static stretching, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF, hold-relax, contract-relax, hold-relax with agonist contraction), dynamic stretching, ballistic stretching, self-myofascial release (foam roller).

Two neurological properties of stretching: autogenic inhibition (activation of Golgi tendon organ GTO inhibits a muscle spindle response) and reciprocal inhibition (activation of a muscle on one side of joint, i.e. the agonist, coincidents with neural inhibition of the opposing muscle, i.e., ).

#### Movement Training

#### Load/Speed Training - plyometrics

Movement pattern: linear forward > lateral > backpadel > rotational > crossover cutting curving

Lower body: jump in place, jumping jacks, alternating push-ff, single linear jump, standing long/vertical jump, multiple linear jumps,
front/lateral cone jump, multidirectional jump, hexagon drill, diagonal cone jump ...

Upper body: power push-ups, medicine ball power push-ups, horizontal chest pass, supine vertical chest toss...

Speed drills: arm squeeze and rear/forward arm drive, ABC (high knee, high marches, butt kicks) drills ...

agility-ladder/hurdle drills: forward/lateral jumps/hops, backpedal, multidirectional; lateral shuffles, pro agility drill ...



## Periodization

intentionally varies the training stimuli, especially with respect to intensity and volume (resistance, repetition, and sets).
Divided into time segments and macrocycles (6-12 months as program timeframe), mesocycle (as specific training goals) and 
microcycles (as a progressive training segment for each mesocycle).
Performed in either a linear manner (consistent protocol) or an undulating approach (different training protocol).



## Program Maitainance 

Strategy #1: minimum dose of activity to maintain weight and cardio health quotes to 1-mile per day.

Strategy #2: low dose HIIT (12min/week) to improve cardio health.

Strategy #3: integrate a single long training session into the biweekly training routine.

Strategy #4: combined cardio and muscular training is an antidote to detraining. 


## Recovery

Frequency, intensity, time/duration, type between bouts (active or passive).

Applications: program active recovery (superior to passive recovery); program-specific recovery intensities, program gait
